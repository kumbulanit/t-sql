---

## Slide 3: What is a Set?
**Mathematical Definition and Properties**

**Set Definition**:
- Collection of distinct, unordered elements
- No duplicate elements allowed
- Order of elements is not significant
- Elements share common characteristics
- Well-defined membership criteria

**Set Examples**:
```sql
-- TechCorp Departments (as a set)
{'Information Technology', 'Human Resources', 'Finance', 'Marketing'}

-- Employee IDs (as a set)
{101, 102, 103, 104, 105}

-- BaseSalary Ranges (as a set)
{50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000}
```

**Set Properties**:
- **Uniqueness**: Each element appears only once
- **Unordered**: Position doesn't matter
- **Well-defined**: Clear membership rules

---

## Slide 4: Sets in Relational Database Context
**Tables as Sets of Rows**

**Database Table = Set Concept**:
```sql
-- Employees table as a set of employee records
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,    -- Ensures uniqueness
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    Department NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Each row is an element in the Employees set
-- Primary key ensures no duplicate rows (set property)
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(101, 'John', 'Smith', 'IT'),        -- Element 1
(102, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'HR'),          -- Element 2
(103, 'Mike', 'Johnson', 'Finance'); -- Element 3
```

**Key Insights**:
- Each row represents one element
- Primary keys enforce uniqueness
- Table structure defines set membership rules
- Query results are also sets

---

## Slide 5: Set Membership and Predicates
**Determining Element Membership**

**Membership Concepts**:
- Element either belongs to set or doesn't
- No partial membership
- Membership determined by criteria
- Boolean result (TRUE/FALSE)

**T-SQL Membership Examples**:
```sql
-- Check if employee belongs to IT department set
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    CASE 
        WHEN d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering' THEN 'Member of IT Set'
        ELSE 'Not Member of IT Set'
    END AS SetMembership
FROM Employees;

-- Using WHERE clause for set membership
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department IN ('IT', 'Finance');  -- Members of specified set

-- BaseSalary range membership
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE BaseSalary BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000;   -- Members of BaseSalary range set
```

---

## Slide 6: Empty Set and Universal Set
**Special Set Types in Database Context**

**Empty Set (∅)**:
```sql
-- Query returning no results = Empty Set
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department = 'NonExistentDept';   -- Returns empty set

-- Checking for empty results
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE BaseSalary > 200000)
    PRINT 'No employees with BaseSalary > 200000 (Empty Set)';
```

**Universal Set**:
```sql
-- All employees = Universal set for this context
SELECT * FROM Employees;  -- Universal set of all employees

-- All records in database context
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE 1 = 1;  -- Always true condition = Universal set
```

**Practical Applications**:
- Error handling for empty results
- Default selections
- Data validation scenarios
- Complete dataset operations

---

## Slide 7: Set Operations - Union
**Combining Sets Without Duplicates**

**Union Concept**:
- Combines elements from two or more sets
- Eliminates duplicates automatically
- Result contains all unique elements
- Order is not guaranteed

**T-SQL UNION Examples**:
```sql
-- Combine IT and HR employees
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, 'IT' AS Source
FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering'

UNION

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, 'HR' AS Source  
FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Human Resources';

-- Union of BaseSalary ranges
SELECT DISTINCT BaseSalary FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering'
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT BaseSalary FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Finance';
```

**UNION vs UNION ALL**:
```sql
-- UNION (removes duplicates - true set operation)
SELECT Department FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT Department FROM Departments;

-- UNION ALL (keeps duplicates - bag operation)
SELECT Department FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT Department FROM Departments;
```

---

## Slide 8: Set Operations - Intersection
**Finding Common Elements**

**Intersection Concept**:
- Elements that exist in both sets
- Common membership requirement
- Result is subset of both original sets
- Can be empty if no common elements

**T-SQL Intersection Examples**:
```sql
-- Employees who are both in IT and have high salaries
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees 
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering'

INTERSECT

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees 
WHERE BaseSalary > 70000;

-- Alternative using JOIN (common approach)
SELECT DISTINCT e1.EmployeeID, e1.FirstName, e1.LastName
FROM Employees e1
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees WHERE BaseSalary > 70000
) e2 ON e1.EmployeeID = e2.EmployeeID
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering';
```

**Business Applications**:
- Finding overlapping criteria
- Qualified candidate identification
- Common customer analysis

---

## Slide 9: Set Operations - Difference
**Elements in One Set But Not Another**

**Difference Concept**:
- Elements in first set but not in second
- Asymmetric operation (A - B ≠ B - A)
- Useful for exclusion scenarios
- Can identify missing or unique elements

**T-SQL Difference Examples**:
```sql
-- Employees in IT but not earning high salaries
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees 
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering'

EXCEPT

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees 
WHERE BaseSalary > 80000;

-- Alternative using NOT EXISTS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees e1
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Employees e2 
    WHERE e2.EmployeeID = e1.EmployeeID 
      AND e2.BaseSalary > 80000
  );
```

**Practical Uses**:
- Finding exceptions
- Data validation
- Exclusion reporting

---

## Slide 10: Cartesian Product
**All Possible Combinations**

**Cartesian Product Concept**:
- Every element from first set paired with every element from second set
- Result size = Size of Set A × Size of Set B
- Usually undesirable in database queries
- Foundation for JOIN operations

**T-SQL Cartesian Product Example**:
```sql
-- Cartesian product (usually unintentional)
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS Employee,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e, Departments d;  -- Missing JOIN condition

-- More explicit syntax
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS Employee,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
CROSS JOIN Departments d;

-- Result: Every employee paired with every department
-- If 10 employees and 4 departments = 40 result rows
```

**Avoiding Unintended Cartesian Products**:
- Always use proper JOIN conditions
- Be explicit with JOIN syntax
- Test with small datasets first

---

## Slide 11: Multisets (Bags) vs Sets
**Handling Duplicates in Database Context**

**Set vs Multiset Differences**:

**True Sets (No Duplicates)**:
```sql
-- DISTINCT enforces set behavior
SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;
-- Result: {'IT', 'HR', 'Finance', 'Marketing'}

-- UNION removes duplicates (set operation)
SELECT Department FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT Department FROM NewEmployees;
```

**Multisets/Bags (Allow Duplicates)**:
```sql
-- Default SQL behavior allows duplicates
SELECT Department FROM Employees;
-- Result: {'IT', 'IT', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'Marketing'}

-- UNION ALL preserves duplicates (multiset operation)
SELECT Department FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT Department FROM NewEmployees;
```

**When to Use Each**:
- Sets for unique values, logical operations
- Multisets for counting, aggregations, preserving all data

---

## Slide 12: Set Theory in WHERE Clauses
**Membership Testing and Filtering**

**Set Membership Operations**:
```sql
-- IN operator (element of set)
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department IN ('IT', 'Finance', 'HR');

-- NOT IN operator (not element of set)
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department NOT IN ('Marketing', 'Sales');

-- EXISTS (non-empty set test)
SELECT * FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Projects p 
    WHERE p.ManagerID = e.EmployeeID
);

-- Range membership (continuous set)
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE BaseSalary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000;  -- [50000, 80000] set
```

**Set-Based Thinking Benefits**:
- Clearer logic
- Better performance
- More maintainable code
- Fewer bugs

---

## Slide 13: Null Values and Set Theory
**Handling Unknown Values in Sets**

**NULL Challenges in Set Operations**:
```sql
-- NULL values in set membership
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department IN ('IT', NULL, 'HR');  -- NULL doesn't match anything

-- NULL-safe comparisons
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department IS NULL;  -- Correct way to check for NULL

-- NULL in set operations
SELECT Department FROM Employees    -- NULLs included
UNION
SELECT Department FROM Contractors;  -- NULLs consolidated to one

-- Handling NULLs in business logic
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    ISNULL(Department, 'Unassigned') AS Department
FROM Employees;
```

**Best Practices for NULLs**:
- Use IS NULL / IS NOT NULL for testing
- Consider business meaning of NULL
- Handle NULLs explicitly in set operations
- Document NULL handling decisions

---

## Slide 14: Set Operations Performance
**Efficient Set-Based Queries**

**Performance Considerations**:
```sql
-- Efficient set membership (indexed column)
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE DepartmentID IN (1, 2, 3);  -- Fast with index

-- Less efficient with functions
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE UPPER(Department) IN ('IT', 'HR');  -- Slower, can't use index

-- Set operations vs JOINs
-- UNION (set operation)
SELECT EmployeeID FROM ActiveEmployees
UNION
SELECT EmployeeID FROM ProjectEmployees;

-- JOIN alternative (often faster)
SELECT DISTINCT e1.EmployeeID
FROM ActiveEmployees e1
FULL OUTER JOIN ProjectEmployees e2 
    ON e1.EmployeeID = e2.EmployeeID;
```

**Optimization Tips**:
- Use indexes on columns in set operations
- Consider JOIN alternatives for complex set operations
- Test performance with realistic data volumes

---

## Slide 15: Real-World TechCorp Set Examples
**Business Applications of Set Theory**

**Employee Management Sets**:
```sql
-- Active employees with specific skills
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees 
WHERE IsActive = 1

INTERSECT

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM EmployeeSkills es
INNER JOIN Skills s ON es.SkillID = s.SkillID
WHERE s.SkillName IN ('C#', 'SQL Server', 'Azure');
```

**Project Assignment Sets**:
```sql
-- Employees available for new projects
SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1

EXCEPT

SELECT DISTINCT EmployeeID FROM ProjectAssignments
WHERE ProjectIsActive = 'Active'
  AND EndDate > GETDATE();
```

**Reporting and Analytics**:
```sql
-- Department union for company-wide reports
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount
FROM (
    SELECT Department FROM FullTimeEmployees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT Department FROM ContractEmployees
) AS AllEmployees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

---

## Slide 16: Set Theory Best Practices
**Professional Application Guidelines**

**Design Principles**:
- Think in terms of sets, not individual records
- Use set operations instead of procedural logic when possible
- Leverage SQL's set-based nature for efficiency
- Design tables to support set operations

**Code Quality**:
```sql
-- Good: Set-based approach
UPDATE Employees 
SET BaseSalary = BaseSalary * 1.10
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering' 
  AND PerformanceRating >= 4;

-- Avoid: Row-by-row processing
DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR 
    SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees e INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering';
-- ... cursor processing logic
```

**Documentation**:
- Explain set logic in comments
- Document business rules as set operations
- Use meaningful names for complex set operations

---

## Slide 17: Common Set Theory Mistakes
**Avoiding Typical Pitfalls**

**Duplicate Handling Errors**:
```sql
-- Mistake: Expecting set behavior but getting multiset
SELECT Department FROM Employees;  -- May have duplicates

-- Correct: Explicitly use DISTINCT for set behavior
SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;
```

**NULL Handling Mistakes**:
```sql
-- Mistake: NULL equality comparison
WHERE Department = NULL;  -- Always false

-- Correct: IS NULL comparison
WHERE Department IS NULL;
```

**Set Operation Confusion**:
```sql
-- Mistake: Wrong set operation
SELECT * FROM A UNION SELECT * FROM B;     -- Union (removes duplicates)
-- When you meant:
SELECT * FROM A UNION ALL SELECT * FROM B; -- Keep all records
```

**Prevention Strategies**:
- Test with edge cases (empty sets, NULLs)
- Understand difference between sets and multisets
- Use explicit syntax for clarity

---

## Slide 18: Advanced Set Concepts
**Complex Set Operations and Relationships**

**Subset Relationships**:
```sql
-- Check if all IT employees have high salaries (subset test)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM Employees 
            WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'Engineering' AND BaseSalary < 70000
        )
        THEN 'All IT employees have high salaries'
        ELSE 'Some IT employees have lower salaries'
    END AS SubsetTest;
```

**Set Equivalence**:
```sql
-- Compare two sets for equality
WITH Set1 AS (SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees),
     Set2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentName AS Department FROM Departments)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT Department FROM Set1 EXCEPT SELECT Department FROM Set2)
         AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT Department FROM Set2 EXCEPT SELECT Department FROM Set1)
        THEN 'Sets are equivalent'
        ELSE 'Sets are different'
    END AS SetComparison;
```

**Power Set Concepts**:
- All possible subsets of a set
- Exponential growth (2^n subsets)
- Useful for permission combinations

---

## Slide 19: Set Theory in Database Design
**Applying Set Concepts to Schema Design**

**Entity Sets**:
- Each table represents a set of entities
- Primary keys ensure uniqueness (set property)
- Foreign keys establish relationships between sets

**Relationship Sets**:
```sql
-- Many-to-many relationship as set of pairs
CREATE TABLE EmployeeProjects (
    EmployeeID INT,
    ProjectID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, ProjectID),  -- Ensures unique pairs
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProjectID) REFERENCES Projects(ProjectID)
);
```

**Domain Sets**:
- Column domains define valid value sets
- CHECK constraints enforce set membership
- Referential integrity maintains set relationships

**Normalization and Sets**:
- First Normal Form eliminates repeating groups (enforces atomic values)
- Higher normal forms minimize redundancy (set efficiency)
