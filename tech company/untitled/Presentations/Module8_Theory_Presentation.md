        THEN 'Valid'
        ELSE 'Invalid'
    END AS PhoneValidation
FROM Employees;
```

---

## Slide 15: Performance Considerations with Functions
**Optimization Strategies**

```sql
-- SARGable vs Non-SARGable predicates
-- BAD: Function on indexed column
WHERE YEAR(HireDate) = 2023                    -- Non-SARGable
WHERE UPPER(LastName) = 'SMITH'                -- Non-SARGable
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, HireDate, GETDATE()) > 365 -- Non-SARGable

-- GOOD: SARGable alternatives
WHERE HireDate >= '2023-01-01' AND HireDate < '2024-01-01'
WHERE LastName = 'Smith'  -- Case-insensitive collation
WHERE HireDate < DATEADD(DAY, -365, GETDATE())

-- Computed columns for complex functions
ALTER TABLE Employees 
ADD HireYear AS YEAR(HireDate) PERSISTED;

CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_HireYear ON Employees(HireYear);
```

---

## Slide 16: Function Nesting and Complexity
**Managing Complex Function Logic**

```sql
-- Complex nested functions
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    
    -- Nested string functions
    UPPER(
        LEFT(
            LTRIM(RTRIM(FirstName)), 1
        )
    ) + 
    LOWER(
        SUBSTRING(
            LTRIM(RTRIM(FirstName)), 
            2, 
            LEN(LTRIM(RTRIM(FirstName))) - 1
        )
    ) AS ProperFirstName,
    
    -- Complex date calculations
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 5 
             AND MONTH(DATEADD(YEAR, 5, HireDate)) = MONTH(GETDATE())
        THEN 'Eligible for 5-year bonus'
        ELSE 'Not eligible'
    END AS BonusEligibility
FROM Employees;
```

---

## Slide 17: User-Defined Functions vs Built-in
**When to Create Custom Functions**

```sql
-- Scalar User-Defined Function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CalculateAge(@BirthDate DATE)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN DATEDIFF(YEAR, @BirthDate, GETDATE()) - 
           CASE WHEN DATEADD(YEAR, DATEDIFF(YEAR, @BirthDate, GETDATE()), @BirthDate) > GETDATE() 
                THEN 1 ELSE 0 END;
END

-- Table-Valued Function
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetEmployeesInDepartment(@DepartmentID INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID AND IsActive = 1
);

-- Usage
SELECT dbo.CalculateAge(BirthDate) AS Age FROM Employees;
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetEmployeesInDepartment(1);
```

---

## Slide 18: Function Performance Best Practices
**Optimization Guidelines**

**Do's:**
- Use built-in functions when possible
- Create indexed computed columns for frequently used expressions
- Use table-valued functions over scalar functions in FROM/JOIN
- Consider deterministic vs non-deterministic functions

**Don'ts:**
- Avoid scalar UDFs in SELECT lists (row-by-row execution)
- Don't use functions on indexed columns in WHERE clauses
- Avoid complex nested function calls in frequently executed queries

```sql
-- Performance comparison
-- Slow: Scalar UDF in SELECT
SELECT EmployeeID, dbo.ComplexCalculation(BaseSalary) FROM Employees;

-- Fast: Inline calculation or computed column
SELECT EmployeeID, BaseSalary * 1.05 * POWER(1.03, 5) FROM Employees;
```

---

## Slide 19: Function Security and Permissions
**Access Control for Functions**

```sql
-- Grant permissions on functions
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.CalculateAge TO [SalesRole];
GRANT SELECT ON dbo.GetEmployeesInDepartment TO [ManagerRole];

-- Schema-bound functions for security
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.SecureEmployeeView()
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID, 
        FirstName, 
        LastName,
        CASE WHEN IS_MEMBER('SalaryViewers') = 1 
             THEN BaseSalary 
             ELSE NULL END AS BaseSalary
    FROM dbo.Employees
    WHERE IsActive = 1
);
```

---

## Slide 20: Cross-Database and Linked Server Functions
**Enterprise Function Usage**

```sql
-- Cross-database function calls
SELECT dbo.CalculateBusinessDays(StartDate, EndDate)
FROM [AnotherDatabase].dbo.Projects;

-- Linked server function usage
SELECT OPENQUERY(LinkedServer, 
    'SELECT CustomerID, CalculateDiscount(PurchaseAmount) FROM Sales'
);

-- Distributed queries with functions
SELECT 
    LocalTable.ID,
    LocalTable.Amount,
    [LinkedServer].[RemoteDB].[dbo].[ConvertCurrency](Amount, 'USD', 'EUR') AS EuroAmount
FROM LocalTable;
```

---

## Slide 21: Function Testing and Debugging
**Quality Assurance for Functions**

```sql
-- Unit testing approach
-- Test edge cases
SELECT dbo.CalculateAge('1900-01-01') AS EdgeCase1;
SELECT dbo.CalculateAge('2099-12-31') AS EdgeCase2;
SELECT dbo.CalculateAge(NULL) AS NullCase;

-- Performance testing
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;
SET STATISTICS IO ON;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees WHERE dbo.ComplexFunction(BaseSalary) > 1000000;

SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;
SET STATISTICS IO OFF;

-- Function validation
SELECT 
    Input,
    ExpectedOutput,
    dbo.TestFunction(Input) AS ActualOutput,
    CASE WHEN dbo.TestFunction(Input) = ExpectedOutput 
         THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END AS TestResult
FROM TestCases;
```

---

## Slide 22: Advanced Aggregation Functions
**Statistical and Business Intelligence Functions**

```sql
-- Statistical aggregate functions
SELECT 
    DepartmentID,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary,
    STDEV(BaseSalary) AS SalaryStdDev,
    VAR(BaseSalary) AS SalaryVariance,
    
    -- Percentile functions
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY BaseSalary) AS MedianSalary,
    PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY BaseSalary) AS Q3Salary,
    
    -- String aggregation
    STRING_AGG(FirstName + ' ' + LastName, ', ') AS EmployeeList
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

---

## Slide 23: Integration with Business Logic
**Real-World Function Applications**

```sql
-- Business rule implementation with functions
SELECT 
    OrderID,
    CustomerID,
    OrderDate,
    OrderAmount,
    
    -- Complex business calculations
    dbo.CalculateDiscount(CustomerID, OrderAmount, OrderDate) AS DiscountAmount,
    dbo.CalculateShipping(CustomerID, OrderAmount, ShipToCountry) AS ShippingCost,
    dbo.CalculateTax(OrderAmount, ShipToState) AS TaxAmount,
    
    -- Final calculations
    OrderAmount - dbo.CalculateDiscount(CustomerID, OrderAmount, OrderDate) +
    dbo.CalculateShipping(CustomerID, OrderAmount, ShipToCountry) +
    dbo.CalculateTax(OrderAmount, ShipToState) AS FinalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE());
```
