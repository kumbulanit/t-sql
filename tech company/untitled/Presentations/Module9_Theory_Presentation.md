## Slide 3: Aggregate Functions Mastery
**Core Statistical Operations**

```sql
-- Comprehensive aggregate analysis
SELECT 
    DepartmentID,
    
    -- Count metrics
    COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(ManagerID) AS EmployeesWithManagers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT JobLevelID) AS UniqueLevels,
    
    -- Financial aggregates
    SUM(BaseSalary) AS TotalPayroll,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AverageSalary,
    MIN(BaseSalary) AS MinimumSalary,
    MAX(BaseSalary) AS MaximumSalary,
    
    -- Statistical measures
    STDEV(BaseSalary) AS SalaryStandardDeviation,
    VAR(BaseSalary) AS SalaryVariance
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

---

## Slide 4: Advanced Statistical Functions
**Business Intelligence Analytics**

```sql
-- Percentile and distribution analysis
SELECT 
    Industry,
    COUNT(*) AS CompanyCount,
    
    -- Revenue percentiles
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY AnnualRevenue) AS Q1Revenue,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY AnnualRevenue) AS MedianRevenue,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY AnnualRevenue) AS Q3Revenue,
    PERCENTILE_DISC(0.90) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY AnnualRevenue) AS Top10PercentRevenue,
    
    -- Range and distribution
    MAX(AnnualRevenue) - MIN(AnnualRevenue) AS RevenueRange,
    STDEV(AnnualRevenue) / AVG(AnnualRevenue) AS CoefficientOfVariation
FROM Companies
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY Industry
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;  -- Minimum sample size for statistical significance
```

---

## Slide 5: GROUP BY Fundamentals
**Data Dimensionality**

```sql
-- Single dimension grouping
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;

-- Multi-dimensional grouping
SELECT 
    Department,
    JobLevel,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS AvgTenure
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department, JobLevel
ORDER BY Department, JobLevel;
```

**Key Concept**: Every non-aggregate column in SELECT must be in GROUP BY

---

## Slide 6: Complex GROUP BY Scenarios
**Multi-Level Business Analysis**

```sql
-- Hierarchical grouping with ROLLUP
SELECT 
    ISNULL(Industry, 'ALL INDUSTRIES') AS Industry,
    ISNULL(CompanySize, 'ALL SIZES') AS CompanySize,
    COUNT(*) AS CompanyCount,
    AVG(AnnualRevenue) AS AvgRevenue,
    SUM(AnnualRevenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Companies
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Industry, CompanySize)
ORDER BY Industry, CompanySize;

-- CUBE for all possible combinations
SELECT 
    ISNULL(Department, 'ALL DEPARTMENTS') AS Department,
    ISNULL(JobLevel, 'ALL LEVELS') AS JobLevel,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY CUBE(Department, JobLevel);
```

---

## Slide 7: HAVING Clause Mastery
**Group-Level Filtering**

```sql
-- Strategic filtering on aggregated data
SELECT 
    DepartmentID,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary,
    SUM(BaseSalary) AS TotalPayroll,
    MAX(HireDate) AS MostRecentHire
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10                    -- Departments with at least 10 employees
    AND AVG(BaseSalary) > 60000              -- Above-average compensation
    AND MAX(HireDate) >= DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())  -- Recent hiring activity
ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC;
```

**Key Distinction**: WHERE filters rows, HAVING filters groups

---

## Slide 8: Complex HAVING Conditions
**Advanced Group Filtering Logic**

```sql
-- Multi-criteria strategic analysis
SELECT 
    c.Industry,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.CompanyID) AS CompanyCount,
    COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS TotalProjects,
    AVG(p.Budget) AS AvgProjectBudget,
    SUM(p.Budget) AS TotalIndustryRevenue,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, p.StartDate, ISNULL(p.ActualEndDate, p.PlannedEndDate))) AS AvgProjectDuration
FROM Companies c
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON c.CompanyID = p.CompanyID
WHERE c.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY c.Industry
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.CompanyID) >= 5           -- Significant industry presence
    AND COUNT(p.ProjectID) >= 20                  -- Substantial project volume
    AND AVG(p.Budget) > 500000                    -- High-value project focus
    AND SUM(p.Budget) > 10000000                  -- Major industry revenue
    AND AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, p.StartDate, ISNULL(p.ActualEndDate, p.PlannedEndDate))) <= 180  -- Efficient delivery
ORDER BY TotalIndustryRevenue DESC;
```

---

## Slide 9: Aggregate Functions with Window Functions
**Advanced Analytical Reporting**

```sql
-- Combining aggregates with window functions
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    DepartmentID,
    BaseSalary,
    
    -- Department-level aggregates
    AVG(BaseSalary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS DeptAvgSalary,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS DeptEmployeeCount,
    SUM(BaseSalary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS DeptTotalPayroll,
    
    -- Running totals and rankings
    SUM(BaseSalary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS RunningPayrollTotal,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC) AS DeptSalaryRank,
    
    -- Comparative analysis
    BaseSalary - AVG(BaseSalary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS SalaryDifference,
    (BaseSalary * 100.0) / SUM(BaseSalary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID) AS PayrollPercentage
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1
ORDER BY DepartmentID, BaseSalary DESC;
```

---

## Slide 10: Time-Based Aggregations
**Temporal Business Intelligence**

```sql
-- Monthly performance trending
SELECT 
    YEAR(p.StartDate) AS ProjectYear,
    MONTH(p.StartDate) AS ProjectMonth,
    DATENAME(MONTH, p.StartDate) AS MonthName,
    
    -- Volume metrics
    COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS MonthlyProjects,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.CompanyID) AS UniqueClients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectManagerID) AS ActiveManagers,
    
    -- Financial metrics
    SUM(p.Budget) AS MonthlyRevenue,
    AVG(p.Budget) AS AvgProjectValue,
    MIN(p.Budget) AS SmallestProject,
    MAX(p.Budget) AS LargestProject,
    
    -- Performance metrics
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, p.StartDate, ISNULL(p.ActualEndDate, p.PlannedEndDate))) AS AvgDuration,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.Status = 'Completed' AND p.ActualEndDate <= p.PlannedEndDate THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN p.Status = 'Completed' THEN 1 END), 0) AS OnTimePercentage
FROM Projects p
WHERE p.IsActive = 1 
    AND p.StartDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())
GROUP BY YEAR(p.StartDate), MONTH(p.StartDate), DATENAME(MONTH, p.StartDate)
HAVING COUNT(p.ProjectID) >= 3  -- Months with significant activity
ORDER BY ProjectYear DESC, ProjectMonth DESC;
```

---

## Slide 11: Conditional Aggregation
**Business Rule Implementation**

```sql
-- Conditional aggregation for complex business metrics
SELECT 
    DepartmentID,
    
    -- Conditional counts
    COUNT(CASE WHEN BaseSalary > 75000 THEN 1 END) AS HighEarners,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 5 THEN 1 END) AS Veterans,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN PerformanceRating >= 4 THEN 1 END) AS HighPerformers,
    
    -- Conditional sums
    SUM(CASE WHEN JobLevel = 'Manager' THEN BaseSalary ELSE 0 END) AS ManagerPayroll,
    SUM(CASE WHEN JobLevel = 'Individual Contributor' THEN BaseSalary ELSE 0 END) AS ICPayroll,
    
    -- Conditional averages
    AVG(CASE WHEN PerformanceRating >= 4 THEN BaseSalary END) AS HighPerformerAvgSalary,
    AVG(CASE WHEN PerformanceRating < 3 THEN BaseSalary END) AS LowPerformerAvgSalary,
    
    -- Complex business calculations
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN PerformanceRating >= 4 THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*) AS HighPerformerPercent,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN JobLevel = 'Manager' THEN BaseSalary ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / SUM(BaseSalary) AS ManagerPayrollPercent
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5  -- Departments with sufficient sample size
ORDER BY HighPerformerPercent DESC;
```

---

## Slide 12: String Aggregation for Reporting
**Consolidating Textual Data**

```sql
-- STRING_AGG for comprehensive reporting (SQL Server 2017+)
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.Industry,
    COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount,
    SUM(p.Budget) AS TotalRevenue,
    
    -- Aggregate project information
    STRING_AGG(p.ProjectName, '; ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p.Budget DESC) AS ProjectList,
    STRING_AGG(CONCAT(p.ProjectName, ' ($', FORMAT(p.Budget, 'N0'), ')'), '; ') 
        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p.Budget DESC) AS ProjectsWithBudgets,
    
    -- Manager aggregation
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT CONCAT(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName), ', ') AS ProjectManagers
FROM Companies c
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON c.CompanyID = p.CompanyID
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
WHERE c.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY c.CompanyID, c.CompanyName, c.Industry
HAVING COUNT(p.ProjectID) >= 3
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```

---

## Slide 13: Performance Optimization for Aggregations
**Enterprise-Scale Efficiency**

```sql
-- Optimized aggregation strategies
-- 1. Use covering indexes
CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_Covering ON Employees (DepartmentID, IsActive) 
INCLUDE (BaseSalary, HireDate, PerformanceRating);

-- 2. Filter early with WHERE
SELECT 
    DepartmentID,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1  -- Filter applied before grouping
    AND HireDate >= '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY DepartmentID;

-- 3. Use indexed computed columns for complex calculations
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD TenureYears AS DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) PERSISTED;
CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_TenureYears ON Employees (TenureYears);

-- 4. Consider partitioned views for very large datasets
-- 5. Use appropriate data types to minimize memory usage
```

---

## Slide 14: Common Aggregation Mistakes
**Pitfalls to Avoid**

```sql
-- Mistake 1: Non-aggregate columns not in GROUP BY
SELECT DepartmentID, FirstName, COUNT(*)  -- ERROR: FirstName not in GROUP BY
FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID;

-- Mistake 2: Using WHERE instead of HAVING for group conditions
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
WHERE COUNT(*) > 5  -- ERROR: Can't use aggregate in WHERE
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
-- CORRECT: Use HAVING COUNT(*) > 5

-- Mistake 3: Forgetting NULL handling in aggregates
SELECT AVG(Bonus) FROM Employees;  -- Ignores NULL values, might not be expected behavior

-- Mistake 4: Incorrect COUNT usage
SELECT COUNT(MiddleName) FROM Employees;  -- Counts only non-NULL values
-- vs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;  -- Counts all rows
```

---

## Slide 15: Advanced Business Scenarios
**Real-World Analytical Challenges**

```sql
-- Customer segmentation analysis
WITH CustomerMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        c.CompanyID,
        c.CompanyName,
        c.Industry,
        COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount,
        SUM(p.Budget) AS TotalRevenue,
        AVG(p.Budget) AS AvgProjectValue,
        MIN(p.StartDate) AS FirstProject,
        MAX(p.StartDate) AS LastProject,
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(p.StartDate), MAX(p.StartDate)) AS RelationshipMonths
    FROM Companies c
        INNER JOIN Projects p ON c.CompanyID = p.CompanyID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1
    GROUP BY c.CompanyID, c.CompanyName, c.Industry
)

        LAG(MonthlyRevenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY YearMonth) AS PreviousMonth,
        AVG(MonthlyRevenue) OVER (ORDER BY YearMonth ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS TwelveMonthAvg
    FROM MonthlyMetrics
)
SELECT 
    Year,
    Month,
    MonthlyRevenue,
    
    -- Year-over-year growth
    CASE

    -- Trend indicator
    CASE 
        WHEN MonthlyRevenue > TwelveMonthAvg * 1.1 THEN 'Above Trend'
        WHEN MonthlyRevenue < TwelveMonthAvg * 0.9 THEN 'Below Trend'
        ELSE 'On Trend'
    END AS TrendStatus
FROM TrendAnalysis
ORDER BY YearMonth DESC;
```
