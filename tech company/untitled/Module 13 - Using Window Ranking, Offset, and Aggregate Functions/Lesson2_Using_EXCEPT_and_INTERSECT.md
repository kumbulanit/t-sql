# Lesson 2: Using EXCEPT and INTERSECT

## Overview

EXCEPT and INTERSECT are advanced set operators that perform mathematical set operations on query results. These operators are essential for data comparison, validation, and sophisticated business analysis. EXCEPT returns rows from the first query that don't appear in the second (set difference), while INTERSECT returns only rows that appear in both queries (set intersection).

## 🏢 TechCorp Business Context

**Set Operations in Enterprise Analysis:**
- **Data Validation**: Finding discrepancies between systems and datasets
- **Compliance Auditing**: Identifying missing or extra records for regulatory compliance
- **Quality Assurance**: Detecting data inconsistencies across business processes
- **Market Analysis**: Finding common patterns and unique characteristics
- **Change Management**: Tracking modifications and identifying impact areas

### 📋 TechCorp Database Schema Reference

**Primary Tables for Set Analysis:**
```sql
Employees: e.EmployeeID (3001+), e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.BaseSalary, DepartmentID, ManagerID, e.JobTitle, e.HireDate, WorkEmail, IsActive
Departments: DepartmentID (2001+), DepartmentName, Budget, Location, IsActive

### Core Characteristics

1. **Automatic Deduplication**: Both operators remove duplicate rows from results
2. **Column Requirements**: Same as UNION - matching column count, compatible types, positional alignment
3. **NULL Handling**: NULL values are considered equal for comparison purposes
4. **Performance**: Generally efficient with proper indexing on comparison columns

## EXCEPT Operations for Data Analysis

### 1. Data Quality and Validation

#### TechCorp Example: Employees Without Project Assignments
```sql
-- Identify employees who should be assigned to projects but aren't
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND e.JobTitle NOT LIKE '%Intern%'  -- Exclude interns
  AND DATEDIFF(MONTH, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 3  -- Employed for at least 3 months

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND ep.IsActive = 1

ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, YearsOfService DESC;
```

#### TechCorp Example: Customers Without Recent Orders
```sql
-- Find customers who were active but haven't placed orders recently
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.City,
    c.Country,
    (SELECT MAX(o.OrderDate) 
     FROM Orders o 
     WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
       AND o.IsActive = 1) AS LastOrderDate,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, 
             (SELECT MAX(o.OrderDate) 
              FROM Orders o 
              WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
                AND o.IsActive = 1), 
             GETDATE()) AS DaysSinceLastOrder
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM Orders o 
      WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
        AND o.IsActive = 1
  )  -- Has historical orders

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.City,
    c.Country,
    (SELECT MAX(o.OrderDate) 
     FROM Orders o 
     WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
       AND o.IsActive = 1) AS LastOrderDate,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, 
             (SELECT MAX(o.OrderDate) 
              FROM Orders o 
              WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
                AND o.IsActive = 1), 
             GETDATE()) AS DaysSinceLastOrder
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND o.IsActive = 1
  AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())  -- Recent orders (6 months)

ORDER BY DaysSinceLastOrder DESC;
```

### 2. Business Rule Compliance

#### TechCorp Example: High Earners Without Management Responsibilities
```sql
-- Identify employees violating company policy: high e.BaseSalary without management duties
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    'Policy Violation: High e.BaseSalary Without Management' AS ComplianceIssue
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.BaseSalary > 85000  -- High e.BaseSalary threshold
  AND e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    mgr.e.EmployeeID,
    mgr.e.FirstName + ' ' + mgr.e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    FORMAT(mgr.e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary,
    mgr.e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, mgr.e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    'Policy Violation: High e.BaseSalary Without Management' AS ComplianceIssue
FROM Employees e mgr
INNER JOIN Departments d ON mgr.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE mgr.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr.e.BaseSalary > 85000
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Employees e subordinate
      WHERE subordinate.ManagerID = mgr.e.EmployeeID
        AND subordinate.IsActive = 1
  )

ORDER BY CurrentSalary DESC, YearsOfService DESC;
```

### 3. Change Detection and Auditing

#### TechCorp Example: New Employee Additions
```sql
-- Track new employees added since last reporting period
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS NewEmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.HireDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS e.HireDate,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS StartingSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.ManagerID IS NOT NULL 
        THEN (SELECT mgr.e.FirstName + ' ' + mgr.e.LastName 
              FROM Employees e mgr 
              WHERE mgr.e.EmployeeID = e.ManagerID 
                AND mgr.IsActive = 1)
        ELSE 'No Manager Assigned'
    END AS ReportsTo
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND e.HireDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())  -- Current period hires

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS NewEmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.HireDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS e.HireDate,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS StartingSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.ManagerID IS NOT NULL 
        THEN (SELECT mgr.e.FirstName + ' ' + mgr.e.LastName 
              FROM Employees e mgr 
              WHERE mgr.e.EmployeeID = e.ManagerID 
                AND mgr.IsActive = 1)
        ELSE 'No Manager Assigned'
    END AS ReportsTo
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND e.HireDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -2, GETDATE())  -- Previous period hires
  AND e.HireDate < DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())

ORDER BY e.HireDate DESC, d.DepartmentName;
```

## INTERSECT Operations for Common Analysis

### 1. Multi-Criteria Employee Analysis

#### TechCorp Example: High-Performing Multi-Skilled Employees
```sql
-- Find employees who are both high earners AND have project management experience
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID)
     FROM Projects p
     WHERE p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
       AND p.IsActive = 1) AS ProjectsManaged,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.BaseSalary >= 90000 THEN 'Top Tier'
        WHEN e.BaseSalary >= 75000 THEN 'High Earner'
        ELSE 'Standard'
    END AS SalaryTier
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.BaseSalary >= 75000  -- High earners
  AND e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1

INTERSECT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID)
     FROM Projects p
     WHERE p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
       AND p.IsActive = 1) AS ProjectsManaged,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.BaseSalary >= 90000 THEN 'Top Tier'
        WHEN e.BaseSalary >= 75000 THEN 'High Earner'
        ELSE 'Standard'
    END AS SalaryTier
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND p.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.JobTitle, d.DepartmentName, e.BaseSalary
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) >= 2  -- Minimum 2 projects managed

ORDER BY CurrentSalary DESC, ProjectsManaged DESC;
```

### 2. Customer Segmentation Analysis

#### TechCorp Example: Premium Multi-Channel Customers
```sql
-- Identify customers who are both high-value AND high-frequency purchasers
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.Country,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
    FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS TotalRevenue,
    FORMAT(AVG(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS AverageOrderValue,
    'Premium Customer' AS CustomerSegment
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND o.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName, c.ContactName, c.Country
HAVING SUM(o.TotalAmount) >= 25000  -- High-value customers

INTERSECT

SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.Country,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
    FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS TotalRevenue,
    FORMAT(AVG(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS AverageOrderValue,
    'Premium Customer' AS CustomerSegment
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND o.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName, c.ContactName, c.Country
HAVING COUNT(o.OrderID) >= 15  -- High-frequency customers

ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC, TotalOrders DESC;
```

### 3. Cross-Department Collaboration Analysis

#### TechCorp Example: Multi-Department Project Contributors
```sql
-- Find employees who work on projects across multiple departments
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    home_dept.DepartmentName AS HomeDepartment,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID)
     FROM EmployeeProjects ep
     INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
     INNER JOIN Employees mgr ON p.ProjectManagerID = mgr.e.EmployeeID
     WHERE ep.e.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
       AND mgr.DepartmentID <> e.DepartmentID
       AND ep.IsActive = 1
       AND p.IsActive = 1
       AND mgr.IsActive = 1) AS CrossDeptProjects
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments home_dept ON e.DepartmentID = home_dept.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep1 ON e.EmployeeID = ep1.e.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p1 ON ep1.ProjectID = p1.ProjectID
INNER JOIN Employees mgr1 ON p1.ProjectManagerID = mgr1.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND home_dept.IsActive = 1
  AND ep1.IsActive = 1
  AND p1.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr1.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr1.DepartmentID = 2001  -- Sales d.DepartmentName projects

INTERSECT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    home_dept.DepartmentName AS HomeDepartment,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID)
     FROM EmployeeProjects ep
     INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
     INNER JOIN Employees mgr ON p.ProjectManagerID = mgr.e.EmployeeID
     WHERE ep.e.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
       AND mgr.DepartmentID <> e.DepartmentID
       AND ep.IsActive = 1
       AND p.IsActive = 1
       AND mgr.IsActive = 1) AS CrossDeptProjects
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments home_dept ON e.DepartmentID = home_dept.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep2 ON e.EmployeeID = ep2.e.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p2 ON ep2.ProjectID = p2.ProjectID
INNER JOIN Employees mgr2 ON p2.ProjectManagerID = mgr2.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND home_dept.IsActive = 1
  AND ep2.IsActive = 1
  AND p2.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr2.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr2.DepartmentID = 2002  -- Marketing d.DepartmentName projects

ORDER BY CrossDeptProjects DESC, HomeDepartment;
```

## Advanced Set Operation Patterns

### 1. Complex Business Rule Validation

#### TechCorp Example: Comprehensive Compliance Audit
```sql
-- Multi-layered compliance check: Employees who meet ALL criteria vs those who don't
WITH HighPerformers AS (
    -- Employees meeting performance criteria
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.BaseSalary,
        'High Performer' AS Classification
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.BaseSalary > (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) * 1.2 FROM Employees e WHERE IsActive = 1)
      AND e.IsActive = 1
      AND d.IsActive = 1
),
ProjectContributors AS (
    -- Employees actively contributing to projects
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.BaseSalary,
        'Project Contributor' AS Classification
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1
      AND d.IsActive = 1
      AND ep.IsActive = 1
      AND ep.StartDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.JobTitle, d.DepartmentName, e.BaseSalary
    HAVING SUM(ep.HoursWorked) >= 100  -- Minimum contribution threshold
)
-- Find high performers who are NOT contributing to projects
SELECT *
FROM HighPerformers
EXCEPT
SELECT 
    pc.e.EmployeeID,
    pc.EmployeeName,
    pc.e.JobTitle,
    pc.DepartmentName,
    pc.e.BaseSalary,
    'High Performer' AS Classification
FROM ProjectContributors pc
ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC;
```

### 2. Market Analysis and Competitive Intelligence

#### TechCorp Example: Customer Behavior Pattern Analysis
```sql
-- Identify customers with specific purchasing patterns
SELECT 
    analysis_results.CustomerID,
    analysis_results.CompanyName,
    analysis_results.CustomerType,
    analysis_results.TotalOrders,
    analysis_results.TotalSpent,
    analysis_results.AnalysisCategory
FROM (
    -- High-value, low-frequency customers (Strategic accounts)
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.CompanyName,
        'Strategic Account' AS CustomerType,
        COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
        FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS TotalSpent,
        'Premium Low-Frequency' AS AnalysisCategory
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1
      AND o.IsActive = 1
    GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName
    HAVING SUM(o.TotalAmount) >= 50000  -- High value
       AND COUNT(o.OrderID) <= 10       -- Low frequency

    INTERSECT

    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.CompanyName,
        'Strategic Account' AS CustomerType,
        COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
        FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS TotalSpent,
        'Premium Low-Frequency' AS AnalysisCategory
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())  -- Recent activity
    GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT YEAR(o.OrderDate)) >= 2  -- Multi-year relationship
) analysis_results
ORDER BY analysis_results.TotalSpent DESC;
```

## Performance Optimization for Set Operations

### 1. Index Strategy for Set Operations

#### Optimized Query with Proper Indexing
```sql
-- Recommended indexes for optimal performance:
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_Active_Salary ON Employees(IsActive, e.BaseSalary) INCLUDE (e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.JobTitle, DepartmentID);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Projects_Active_Manager ON Projects(IsActive, ProjectManagerID) INCLUDE (ProjectID, ProjectName, Budget);

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS e.BaseSalary
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND e.BaseSalary > 70000

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS e.BaseSalary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND p.IsActive = 1
  AND e.BaseSalary > 70000

ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC;
```

### 2. Alternative Approaches for Better Performance

#### Using EXISTS/NOT EXISTS vs Set Operations
```sql
-- Set operation approach
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND o.IsActive = 1;

-- Alternative: NOT EXISTS approach (often more efficient)
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Orders o
      WHERE o.e.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
        AND o.IsActive = 1
  );

-- INTERSECT alternative: EXISTS approach
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Projects p
      WHERE p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
        AND p.IsActive = 1
  )
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Orders o
      WHERE o.e.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
        AND o.IsActive = 1
  );
```

## Business Intelligence Applications

### 1. Executive Reporting and KPIs

#### TechCorp Example: Executive Dashboard Metrics
```sql
-- Key performance indicators requiring set operations
SELECT 
    'Employee Utilization' AS KPICategory,
    'Underutilized High Earners' AS KPIName,
    COUNT(*) AS KPIValue,
    'Critical' AS AlertLevel,
    'High-e.BaseSalary employees without project assignments may indicate resource inefficiency' AS BusinessImpact
FROM (
    SELECT e.EmployeeID
    FROM Employees e
    WHERE e.BaseSalary > 80000 AND e.IsActive = 1
    EXCEPT
    SELECT DISTINCT e.EmployeeID
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND ep.IsActive = 1
) underutilized

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Customer Retention' AS KPICategory,
    'At-Risk Premium Customers' AS KPIName,
    COUNT(*) AS KPIValue,
    'High' AS AlertLevel,
    'High-value customers without recent orders may churn and impact revenue' AS BusinessImpact
FROM (
    SELECT c.CustomerID
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1 AND o.IsActive = 1
    GROUP BY c.CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(o.TotalAmount) > 20000
    EXCEPT
    SELECT DISTINCT c.CustomerID
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1 
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
) at_risk_customers

ORDER BY 
    CASE AlertLevel 
        WHEN 'Critical' THEN 1 
        WHEN 'High' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3 
        ELSE 4 
    END;
```

## Best Practices and Common Patterns

### 1. Efficient Query Design

#### Clear Business Logic Implementation
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Clear, well-documented set operations
-- Business Rule: Find senior employees (5+ years) who lack project leadership experience
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    'Leadership Development Candidate' AS RecommendedAction
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 5  -- Senior employees

EXCEPT

-- Remove employees who already have project leadership experience
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    'Leadership Development Candidate' AS RecommendedAction
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND p.IsActive = 1
  AND DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 5

ORDER BY YearsOfService DESC, d.DepartmentName;
```

### 2. Data Validation Patterns

#### Comprehensive Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Multi-layered data validation using set operations
SELECT ValidationResults.*
FROM (
    -- Check 1: Employees without valid d.DepartmentName assignments
    SELECT 
        'Data Integrity' AS ValidationCategory,
        'Employees with Invalid Departments' AS ValidationRule,
        COUNT(*) AS IssueCount,
        'Critical' AS Severity
    FROM (
        SELECT e.EmployeeID
        FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.IsActive = 1
        EXCEPT
        SELECT e.EmployeeID
        FROM Employees e
        INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND d.IsActive = 1
    ) invalid_dept_employees

    UNION ALL

    -- Check 2: Projects without valid managers
    SELECT 
        'Data Integrity' AS ValidationCategory,
        'Projects with Invalid Managers' AS ValidationRule,
        COUNT(*) AS IssueCount,
        'Critical' AS Severity
    FROM (
        SELECT p.ProjectID
        FROM Projects p
        WHERE p.IsActive = 1
        EXCEPT
        SELECT p.ProjectID
        FROM Projects p
        INNER JOIN Employees e ON p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
        WHERE p.IsActive = 1 AND e.IsActive = 1
    ) invalid_mgr_projects
) ValidationResults
WHERE ValidationResults.IssueCount > 0
ORDER BY 
    CASE Severity 
        WHEN 'Critical' THEN 1 
        WHEN 'High' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3 
        ELSE 4 
    END;
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. NULL Value Handling

#### Understanding NULL Equality in Set Operations
```sql
-- Set operations treat NULL as equal to NULL
-- This may produce unexpected results

-- Example: Finding employees without email addresses
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, WorkEmail
FROM Employees e
WHERE IsActive = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, WorkEmail
FROM Employees e
WHERE IsActive = 1 AND WorkEmail IS NOT NULL;

-- This correctly identifies employees with NULL email addresses
-- because NULL = NULL in set operations
```

### 2. Column Ordering and Data Type Consistency

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Inconsistent column types or order
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.BaseSalary FROM Employees e  -- INT, DECIMAL
EXCEPT
SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers;  -- INT, VARCHAR

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Ensure compatible types and consistent column order
SELECT 
    CAST(e.EmployeeID AS VARCHAR(20)) AS RecordID,
    CAST(e.BaseSalary AS VARCHAR(20)) AS RecordValue
FROM Employees e
WHERE IsActive = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT 
    CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR(20)) AS RecordID,
    ContactName AS RecordValue
FROM Customers
WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

### 3. Performance Issues with Large Datasets

#### Optimization Strategies
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Set operations on large unfiltered datasets
SELECT * FROM LargeTable1
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM LargeTable2;

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Filter early and use appropriate indexes
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE IsActive = 1
  AND DepartmentID IN (2001, 2002)  -- Filter early
EXCEPT
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE IsActive = 1
  AND DepartmentID IN (2001, 2002)  -- Consistent filtering
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM EmployeeProjects ep
      WHERE ep.e.EmployeeID = Employees.e.EmployeeID
        AND ep.IsActive = 1
  );
```
