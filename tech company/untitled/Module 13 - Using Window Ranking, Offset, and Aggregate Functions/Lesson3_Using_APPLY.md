# Lesson 3: Using APPLY

## Overview

The APPLY operator is a powerful T-SQL feature that enables table-valued expressions to be evaluated for each row of an outer table expression. This unique operator comes in two forms: CROSS APPLY (similar to INNER JOIN) and OUTER APPLY (similar to LEFT OUTER JOIN). APPLY operations are essential for advanced per-row processing, complex calculations, and sophisticated business analytics in TechCorp's data analysis scenarios.

## 🏢 TechCorp Business Context

**APPLY Operations in Enterprise Analytics:**
- **Per-Row Analytics**: Calculating dynamic metrics for each individual record
- **Top-N Analysis**: Finding top performers within each category or group
- **Complex Aggregations**: Performing sophisticated calculations based on row context
- **Hierarchical Analysis**: Processing parent-child relationships dynamically
- **Business Intelligence**: Creating advanced dashboards with contextual data

### 📋 TechCorp Database Schema Reference

**Core Tables for APPLY Operations:**
```sql
Employees: EmployeeID (3001+), FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary, DepartmentID, ManagerID, JobTitle, HireDate, WorkEmail, IsActive
Departments: DepartmentID (2001+), DepartmentName, Budget, Location, IsActive
Projects: ProjectID (4001+), ProjectName, Budget, ProjectManagerID, StartDate, EndDate, IsActive
Orders: OrderID (5001+), CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, IsActive
EmployeeProjects: EmployeeID, ProjectID, Role, StartDate, EndDate, HoursWorked, IsActive
Customers: CustomerID (6001+), CompanyName, ContactName, City, Country, WorkEmail, IsActive
```

### When to Use APPLY vs Alternatives

1. **Top-N per Group**: APPLY is often more efficient than window functions for small N
2. **Complex Correlations**: When you need more than simple column relationships
3. **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter conditions that depend on outer row values
4. **Table-Valued Functions**: Applying functions that return result sets
5. **Performance**: Sometimes faster than correlated subqueries for complex logic

## Basic APPLY Patterns

### 1. Top-N Analysis per Category

#### TechCorp Example: Top Performers by d.DepartmentName
```sql
-- Find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each d.DepartmentName with detailed metrics
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    d.Budget AS DepartmentBudget,
    d.Location,
    top_earners.EmployeeName,
    top_earners.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(top_earners.BaseSalary, 'C') AS BaseSalary,
    top_earners.YearsOfService,
    top_earners.SalaryRank,
    CAST((top_earners.BaseSalary * 100.0 / d.Budget) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS SalaryBudgetPercentage
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        e.BaseSalary,
        DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS SalaryRank
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC
) top_earners
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, top_earners.BaseSalary DESC;
```

#### TechCorp Example: Most Recent Customer Orders
```sql
-- Get the 5 most recent orders for each customer with order details
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.Country,
    recent_orders.OrderDate,
    FORMAT(recent_orders.TotalAmount, 'C') AS OrderAmount,
    recent_orders.OrderRank,
    recent_orders.ProcessedBy,
    recent_orders.DaysSincePreviousOrder
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 5
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC) AS OrderRank,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS ProcessedBy,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, 
                 LAG(o.OrderDate) OVER (ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC),
                 o.OrderDate) AS DaysSincePreviousOrder
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM Orders o 
      WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
        AND o.IsActive = 1
  )
ORDER BY c.CompanyName, recent_orders.OrderDate DESC;
```

### 2. Complex Per-Row Calculations

#### TechCorp Example: Employee Performance Analytics
```sql
-- Calculate comprehensive performance metrics for each employee
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS BaseSalary,
    performance_data.ProjectEngagement,
    performance_data.CustomerInteraction,
    performance_data.TeamLeadership,
    performance_data.OverallScore,
    performance_data.PerformanceCategory,
    performance_data.RecommendedActions

INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        -- Project engagement metrics
        project_metrics.ProjectScore AS ProjectEngagement,
        -- Customer interaction metrics
        customer_metrics.CustomerScore AS CustomerInteraction,
        -- Team leadership metrics
        leadership_metrics.LeadershipScore AS TeamLeadership,
        -- Calculate overall performance score

            (customer_metrics.CustomerScore * 0.3) + 
            (leadership_metrics.LeadershipScore * 0.3)
        ) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS OverallScore,
        -- Performance categorization

```

## Performance Optimization with APPLY

### 1. Index Strategy for APPLY Operations

#### Optimized APPLY Query Design
```sql
-- Recommended indexes for optimal APPLY performance:
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_Department_Salary ON Employees(DepartmentID, BaseSalary DESC, IsActive) INCLUDE (FirstName, LastName, JobTitle);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_Customer_Date ON Orders(CustomerID, OrderDate DESC, IsActive) INCLUDE (TotalAmount, EmployeeID);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_EmployeeProjects_Employee_Hours ON EmployeeProjects(EmployeeID, IsActive) INCLUDE (ProjectID, HoursWorked);

SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    top_performers.EmployeeName,
    top_performers.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(top_performers.BaseSalary, 'C') AS BaseSalary,
    top_performers.PerformanceRank
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        e.BaseSalary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS PerformanceRank
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID  -- Uses index efficiently
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC
) top_performers
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, top_performers.BaseSalary DESC;
```

### 2. APPLY vs Alternative Query Patterns

#### Performance Comparison Analysis
```sql
-- APPLY approach (efficient for Top-N with complex logic)
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    recent_orders.OrderDate,
    recent_orders.TotalAmount,
    recent_orders.ProcessedBy
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS ProcessedBy
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1;

-- Window function alternative (may be less efficient for small Top-N)
SELECT 
    CompanyName,
    OrderDate,
    TotalAmount,
    ProcessedBy
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.CompanyName,
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS ProcessedBy,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.CustomerID ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC) AS rn
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE c.IsActive = 1
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
) ranked
WHERE rn <= 3
ORDER BY CompanyName, OrderDate DESC;
```

## Best Practices for APPLY Operations

### 1. Proper Query Structure and Readability

#### Well-Structured APPLY Implementation
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Clear structure with meaningful aliases and comments
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    d.DepartmentName,
    recent_activity.ProjectCount,
    recent_activity.LatestProject,
    recent_activity.OrderCount,
    recent_activity.LatestOrder
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
OUTER APPLY (
    -- Comprehensive recent activity analysis for each employee
    SELECT 
        project_summary.ProjectCount,
        project_summary.LatestProject,
        order_summary.OrderCount,
        order_summary.LatestOrder
    FROM (
        -- Recent project involvement
        SELECT 
            COUNT(DISTINCT ep.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount,
            MAX(p.ProjectName) AS LatestProject
        FROM EmployeeProjects ep
        INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
        WHERE ep.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
          AND ep.StartDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
          AND ep.IsActive = 1
          AND p.IsActive = 1
    ) project_summary
    CROSS JOIN (
        -- Recent order processing
        SELECT 
            COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount,
            MAX(c.CompanyName) AS LatestOrder
        FROM Orders o
        INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
        WHERE o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
          AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
          AND o.IsActive = 1
          AND c.IsActive = 1
    ) order_summary
) recent_activity
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY e.LastName, e.FirstName;
```

### 2. Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### Robust NULL and Empty Result Handling
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive NULL handling with OUTER APPLY
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    ISNULL(dept_stats.EmployeeCount, 0) AS EmployeeCount,
    ISNULL(FORMAT(dept_stats.AvgSalary, 'C'), 'N/A') AS AvgSalary,
    ISNULL(dept_stats.TopEmployee, 'No Employees') AS TopEmployee,
    ISNULL(dept_stats.ProjectCount, 0) AS ActiveProjects,
    CASE 
        WHEN dept_stats.EmployeeCount IS NULL OR dept_stats.EmployeeCount = 0 
        THEN 'Requires Immediate Attention'
        WHEN dept_stats.EmployeeCount < 3 
        THEN 'Consider Restructuring'
        ELSE 'Operational'
    END AS DepartmentStatus
FROM Departments d
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT 
        employee_data.EmployeeCount,
        employee_data.AvgSalary,
        employee_data.TopEmployee,
        project_data.ProjectCount
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
            AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary,
            MAX(e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName) AS TopEmployee
        FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
          AND e.IsActive = 1
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 0  -- Only return results if employees exist
    ) employee_data
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount
        FROM Projects p
        INNER JOIN Employees e ON p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
          AND p.IsActive = 1
          AND e.IsActive = 1
    ) project_data
) dept_stats
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY 
    CASE DepartmentStatus 
        WHEN 'Requires Immediate Attention' THEN 1
        WHEN 'Consider Restructuring' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END,
    d.DepartmentName;
```

### 3. Performance Considerations

#### Efficient Filtering and Resource Management
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Early filtering and appropriate TOP usage
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.Country,
    high_value_orders.OrderDate,
    FORMAT(high_value_orders.TotalAmount, 'C') AS OrderAmount,
    high_value_orders.ProcessedBy
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 5
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS ProcessedBy
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.TotalAmount >= 5000  -- Filter for high-value orders early
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())  -- Recent orders only
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.TotalAmount DESC
) high_value_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND c.Country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK')  -- Filter customers early
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Orders o
      WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
        AND o.TotalAmount >= 5000
        AND o.IsActive = 1
  )
ORDER BY c.CompanyName;
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Performance Issues with Large Datasets

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Inefficient APPLY without proper filtering
SELECT c.CompanyName, all_orders.*
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT * FROM Orders o 
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID  -- No filtering, returns all orders
) all_orders;

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Proper filtering and limiting
SELECT c.CompanyName, recent_significant_orders.*
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 10
        o.OrderID,
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.TotalAmount >= 1000  -- Filter by value
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())  -- Recent orders only
      AND o.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_significant_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND c.Country = 'USA';  -- Filter customers early
```

### 2. Incorrect Use of CROSS APPLY vs OUTER APPLY

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Using CROSS APPLY when you want all departments
SELECT d.DepartmentName, emp.FirstName, emp.BaseSalary
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 FirstName, BaseSalary
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID 
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
) emp;  -- This excludes departments with no employees

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Use OUTER APPLY to include all departments
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    ISNULL(emp.FirstName, 'No Employees') AS TopEmployee,
    ISNULL(FORMAT(emp.BaseSalary, 'C'), 'N/A') AS TopSalary
FROM Departments d
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 FirstName, BaseSalary
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID 
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
) emp
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName;
```

### 3. Complex Nested APPLY Operations

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Overly complex nested APPLY (hard to maintain)
SELECT d.DepartmentName, complex_data.*
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT nested_data.* 
    FROM (
        SELECT inner_data.* 
        FROM (
            SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Employees e1
            CROSS APPLY (
                SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Orders o1 
                WHERE o1.EmployeeID = e1.EmployeeID
            ) nested_orders
            WHERE e1.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        ) inner_data
    ) nested_data
) complex_data;

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Break into simpler, more readable CTEs
WITH DepartmentTopEmployee AS (
    SELECT 
        d.DepartmentID,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.BaseSalary
    FROM Departments d
    CROSS APPLY (
        SELECT TOP 1 EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
        FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID 
          AND e.IsActive = 1
        ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
    ) e
    WHERE d.IsActive = 1
)
SELECT dte.d.DepartmentName,
    dte.EmployeeName,
    FORMAT(dte.BaseSalary, 'C') AS TopEmployeeSalary,
    recent_order.OrderDate,
    FORMAT(recent_order.TotalAmount, 'C') AS RecentOrderAmount
FROM DepartmentTopEmployee dte
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 OrderDate, TotalAmount
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.EmployeeID = dte.EmployeeID 
      AND o.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY OrderDate DESC
) recent_order
ORDER BY dte.d.DepartmentName;
```
