# Lesson 2: Using EXCEPT and INTERSECT

## Overview

The EXCEPT and INTERSECT operators are powerful set operators that enable sophisticated data comparison and analysis. EXCEPT finds rows that exist in the first query but not in the second, while INTERSECT finds rows that exist in both queries. These operators are essential for data auditing, comparison analysis, and identifying relationships between datasets. For TechCorp's business intelligence and data quality initiatives, these operators provide precise tools for identifying data discrepancies and commonalities.

## 🏢 TechCorp Business Context

**EXCEPT and INTERSECT in Business Analysis:**

- **Data Auditing**: Identifying discrepancies between expected and actual data
- **Employee Analysis**: Finding employees who meet specific criteria combinations
- **Project Management**: Comparing planned vs. actual project assignments
- **Customer Analysis**: Identifying customer behavior patterns and segments
- **Compliance Reporting**: Ensuring data consistency across different systems

### 📋 TechCorp Database Schema Reference

**Core Tables for EXCEPT/INTERSECT Examples:**

```sql
Employees: e.EmployeeID (3001+), e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.BaseSalary, d.DepartmentID, ManagerID, e.HireDate, IsActive
Departments: d.DepartmentID (2001+), d.DepartmentName, d.Budget, Location, IsActive
Projects: ProjectID (4001+), ProjectName, d.Budget, ProjectManagerID, StartDate, EndDate, IsActive
Orders: OrderID (5001+), CustomerID, e.EmployeeID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, IsActive
Customers: CustomerID (6001+), CompanyName, ContactName, City, Country, IsActive
EmployeeProjects: e.EmployeeID, ProjectID, Role, StartDate, EndDate, HoursWorked, IsActive
```

## 2.1 Understanding EXCEPT Operator

### EXCEPT Operator Fundamentals

The EXCEPT operator returns rows from the first query that do not exist in the second query, effectively performing a "subtraction" operation on datasets.

### TechCorp Example: Identifying Unassigned Employees

```sql
-- Example: Find employees who are not currently assigned to any active projects
-- This helps identify available resources for new project assignments

-- Find employees without current project assignments
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.BaseSalary,
    e.HireDate
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.BaseSalary,
    e.HireDate
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
AND ep.IsActive = 1
AND (ep.EndDate IS NULL OR ep.EndDate > GETDATE())

ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, EmployeeName;

-- Verification: Count available employees by d.DepartmentName
SELECT 
    'Available Resource Summary' AS ReportType,
    d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS AvailableEmployees,
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AverageBaseSalary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.BaseSalary,

## 2.2 Understanding INTERSECT Operator

### INTERSECT Operator Fundamentals

The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that exist in both queries, effectively finding the common elements between two datasets.

```sql
-- TechCorp Example: Find employees who are both project managers and team members
-- This identifies employees with dual roles in project management

-- Find employees who serve as both project managers and team members
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1

INTERSECT

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND ep.IsActive = 1

ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, EmployeeName;

-- Extended analysis: Show their dual roles
SELECT 
    dual_role.EmployeeID,
    dual_role.EmployeeName,
    dual_role.d.DepartmentName,
    'PROJECT_MANAGER' AS RoleType,
    p.ProjectName AS ProjectContext,
    p.d.Budget AS RelatedBudget
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1

    INTERSECT

    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND ep.IsActive = 1
) AS dual_role
INNER JOIN Projects p ON dual_role.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
WHERE p.IsActive = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    dual_role.EmployeeID,
    dual_role.EmployeeName,
    dual_role.d.DepartmentName,
    'TEAM_MEMBER' AS RoleType,
    p.ProjectName AS ProjectContext,
    NULL AS RelatedBudget
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.ProjectManagerID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1

    INTERSECT

    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,
        d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND ep.IsActive = 1
) AS dual_role
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON dual_role.EmployeeID = ep.e.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE ep.IsActive = 1 AND p.IsActive = 1

ORDER BY e.EmployeeID, RoleType, ProjectContext;
```

## 2.6 Using APPLY Operator

### APPLY Operator Fundamentals

The APPLY operator enables you to invoke a table-valued function for each row of a table expression. There are two forms: CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY.

```sql
-- TechCorp Example: Using CROSS APPLY for correlated operations
-- Find top 3 highest-paid employees in each d.DepartmentName

-- Using CROSS APPLY to get top employees per d.DepartmentName
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    top_employees.EmployeeRank,
    top_employees.EmployeeName,
    top_employees.e.JobTitle,
    top_employees.e.BaseSalary,
    top_employees.e.HireDate
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS EmployeeRank,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        e.JobTitle,

### Advanced APPLY Scenarios

```sql
-- TechCorp Example: Complex project analysis using APPLY
-- Analyze project performance with employee contribution details

-- Create a table-valued function for project analysis (run this separately)
