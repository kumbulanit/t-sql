# Lesson 1: Adding Data to Tables - Advanced

## Overview
This advanced lesson explores sophisticated techniques, enterprise-level patterns, and performance optimization strategies for lesson 1: adding data to tables. Building on fundamental concepts, we'll dive deep into complex scenarios and best practices.

## Advanced Concepts and Patterns

### Enterprise-Level Implementation
Building production-ready solutions requires understanding of:

- Performance optimization techniques
- Scalability considerations  
- Error handling and resilience
- Security best practices
- Monitoring and diagnostics

### Complex Scenario Handling

#### Advanced Pattern 1: Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Advanced example with performance considerations
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Set performance monitoring
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;

-- Complex query with optimization
-- [Advanced SQL example based on lesson topic]
```

#### Advanced Pattern 2: Error Handling
```sql
-- Production-ready implementation with error handling
BEGIN TRY
    -- Advanced implementation
    -- [Complex example with proper error handling]
    
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Comprehensive error handling
    SELECT 
        ERROR_NUMBER() as ErrorNumber,
        ERROR_MESSAGE() as ErrorMessage,
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() as ErrorProcedure,
        ERROR_LINE() as ErrorLine;
END CATCH;
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques
