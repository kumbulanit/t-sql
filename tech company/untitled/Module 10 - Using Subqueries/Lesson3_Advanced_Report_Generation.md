# Lesson 3: Advanced Report Generation and Output Formatting

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced report generation techniques
- Learn to create professional-looking reports from SQL queries
- Understand output formatting for different audiences
- Explore automated report generation concepts

## 3.1 Introduction to SQL Server Reporting

Reports transform raw data into meaningful information for decision-makers. This lesson covers creating reports directly from SQL queries and formatting them for professional presentation.

### Types of Reports

- **Operational Reports**: Day-to-day business operations
- **Analytical Reports**: Trends and patterns analysis  
- **Executive Dashboards**: High-level summaries
- **Compliance Reports**: Regulatory requirements
- **Ad-hoc Reports**: Custom queries and analysis

## 3.2 Creating Professional Report Headers and Footers

### Standard Report Header Template

```sql
-- Report header information
DECLARE @ReportDate DATETIME = GETDATE();
DECLARE @ReportTitle VARCHAR(100) = 'TechCorp Solutions - Employee Analysis Report';

SELECT 
    '================================================================================================' AS ReportSeparator
UNION ALL
SELECT @ReportTitle
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'Generated on: ' + FORMAT(@ReportDate, 'MMMM dd, yyyy') + ' at ' + FORMAT(@ReportDate, 'hh:mm tt')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Report Period: ' + FORMAT(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, @ReportDate), 'MMMM yyyy')
UNION ALL
SELECT '================================================================================================'
UNION ALL
SELECT ''; -- Empty line

-- Main report data follows
SELECT 
    'üìä DEPARTMENT SUMMARY' AS SectionTitle
UNION ALL
SELECT '';
```

### Dynamic Report Metadata

```sql
-- Create comprehensive report metadata

## 3.5 Automated Report Scheduling Concepts

### Report Parameter Templates

```sql
-- Parameterized report template
DECLARE @StartDate DATE = DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE());
DECLARE @EndDate DATE = GETDATE();
DECLARE @DepartmentFilter VARCHAR(50) = NULL; -- NULL = All Departments

WITH ParameterizedReport AS (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.JobTitle,
        e.HireDate,
        FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C0') AS Salary
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE 
        (@DepartmentFilter IS NULL OR d.DepartmentName = @DepartmentFilter)
        AND e.HireDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate
)
SELECT 
    'üìã EMPLOYEE REPORT - ' + 
    CASE WHEN @DepartmentFilter IS NULL 
         THEN 'ALL DEPARTMENTS' 
         ELSE UPPER(@DepartmentFilter) 
    END AS ReportTitle
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Period: ' + FORMAT(@StartDate, 'MMM dd, yyyy') + ' to ' + FORMAT(@EndDate, 'MMM dd, yyyy')
UNION ALL
SELECT REPLICATE('‚îÄ', 80)
UNION ALL
SELECT ''
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    LEFT(EmployeeName + SPACE(30), 30) +
    LEFT(DepartmentName + SPACE(20), 20) +
    LEFT(JobTitle + SPACE(25), 25) +
    Salary
FROM ParameterizedReport;
```

### Export-Ready Format

```sql
-- CSV-friendly report format
SELECT 
    '"Report_Type","Department","Metric","Value","Period"' AS CSVHeader
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '"Employee Count","' + d.DepartmentName + '","Total Employees","' + 
    CAST(COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS VARCHAR) + '","' + 
    FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'yyyy-MM') + '"'
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '"Salary Analysis","' + d.DepartmentName + '","Average Salary","' + 
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') + '","' + 
    FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'yyyy-MM') + '"'
FROM Departments d
INNER JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
WHERE e.BaseSalary IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
```

## 3.6 Report Quality and Validation

### Data Quality Checks

```sql
-- Report validation and quality checks
WITH DataQuality AS (
    SELECT 
        'Employee Data' AS DataCategory,
        COUNT(*) AS TotalRecords,
        SUM(CASE WHEN FirstName IS NULL OR LastName IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingNames,
        SUM(CASE WHEN WorkEmail IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingEmails,
        SUM(CASE WHEN BaseSalary IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingSalaries,
        SUM(CASE WHEN HireDate IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingHireDates
    FROM Employees
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Project Data',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN ProjectName IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        SUM(CASE WHEN Status IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        SUM(CASE WHEN Budget IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        SUM(CASE WHEN StartDate IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
    FROM Projects
)
SELECT 
    'üîç DATA QUALITY REPORT' AS QualityHeader
UNION ALL
SELECT REPLICATE('‚ïê', 60)
UNION ALL
SELECT ''
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    LEFT(DataCategory + SPACE(20), 20) +
    'Records: ' + CAST(TotalRecords AS VARCHAR) + 
    ' | Missing Names: ' + CAST(MissingNames AS VARCHAR) +
    ' | Missing Key Fields: ' + CAST(MissingEmails + MissingSalaries AS VARCHAR)
FROM DataQuality;
```

## 3.7 Interactive Report Features

### Drill-Down Report Structure

```sql
-- Hierarchical drill-down report
WITH HierarchicalData AS (
    -- Level 1: Company Overview
    SELECT 
        1 AS Level,
        'COMPANY' AS Category,
        'TechCorp Solutions' AS Name,
        CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees) AS VARCHAR) AS Value,
        'Total Employees' AS Metric
        
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Level 2: Department Summary
    SELECT 
        2,
        'DEPARTMENT',
        d.DepartmentName,
        CAST(COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS VARCHAR),
        'Employees'
    FROM Departments d
    LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Level 3: Individual Employees
    SELECT 
        3,
        'EMPLOYEE',
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName,
        FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C0'),
        'Salary'
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
)
SELECT 
    REPLICATE('  ', Level - 1) + 
    CASE Level 
        WHEN 1 THEN 'üè¢ '
        WHEN 2 THEN 'üìä '
        WHEN 3 THEN 'üë§ '
    END +
    Name + ' (' + Value + ' ' + Metric + ')'
FROM HierarchicalData
ORDER BY Level, Name;
```
