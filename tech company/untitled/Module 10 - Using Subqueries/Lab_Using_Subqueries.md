## Exercise 1: Self-Contained Subqueries (Basic Level)

### 1.1 Scalar Subquery Challenge

**Business Problem:** The HR d.DepartmentName needs to identify all employees earning above the company average e.BaseSalary for budget planning purposes.

**Your Task:** Write a query that shows employee details for those earning above the company average e.BaseSalary. Include employee name, job title, e.BaseSalary, and how much above average they earn.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- Employee Name (First + Last)
- Job Title
- Current e.BaseSalary
- Company Average e.BaseSalary
- Difference from Average

**Hint:** Use a scalar subquery to calculate the company average e.BaseSalary.

```sql
-- Write your solution here:

-- Expected approach: Use scalar subquery in SELECT and WHERE clauses
```

### 1.2 Multi-Value Subquery Challenge

**Business Problem:** The sales team wants to focus on customers who have placed orders with amounts that match the top 5 order values in the system.

**Your Task:** Find all customers who have placed orders with amounts that match any of the top 5 highest order values in the database.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- Customer Company Name
- Contact Name
- Order Amount
- Order Date

**Hint:** Use IN with a subquery that finds the top 5 order amounts.

```sql

**Your Task:** Find all employees who manage other employees but have no project assignments.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- Manager Name
- Job Title
- d.DepartmentName Name
- Number of Direct Reports
- Hire Date

**Hint:** Use EXISTS to check for subordinates and NOT EXISTS to check for no projects.

```sql
-- Write your solution here:

-- Expected approach: EXISTS for managers, NOT EXISTS for projects
```

### 3.2 Customer Activity Analysis Challenge

**Business Problem:** The customer success team wants to identify "at-risk" customers who have placed orders before but haven't ordered anything in the last 6 months.

**Your Task:** Find customers who have historical orders but no recent activity.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- Company Name
- Contact Name
- Last Order Date
- Days Since Last Order
- Total Historical Orders
- Total Historical Revenue

**Hint:** Use EXISTS for historical orders and NOT EXISTS for recent orders.

```sql
-- Write your solution here:

-- Expected approach: EXISTS for any orders, NOT EXISTS for recent orders
```

---

## Exercise 4: Complex Subquery Combinations (Advanced Level)

### 4.1 Multi-Dimensional Analysis Challenge

## Exercise Solutions

### Solution 1.1: Scalar Subquery Challenge

```sql
-- HR Department: Employees Above Company Average
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS CurrentSalary,
    FORMAT((SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) 
            FROM Employees e 
            WHERE IsActive = 1), 'C') AS CompanyAverageSalary,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary - (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) 
                           FROM Employees e 
                           WHERE IsActive = 1), 'C') AS DifferenceFromAverage,
    CAST((e.BaseSalary - (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) FROM Employees e WHERE IsActive = 1)) * 100.0 / 
         (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) FROM Employees e WHERE IsActive = 1) AS DECIMAL(5,1)) AS PercentAboveAverage
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.BaseSalary > (
    SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary)
    FROM Employees e
    WHERE IsActive = 1
)
  AND e.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC;
```

**Key Learning Points:**
- Scalar subqueries return single values
- Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING clauses
- Same subquery can be reused multiple times
- Consider performance implications of repeated subqueries

### Solution 1.2: Multi-Value Subquery Challenge

```sql
-- Sales Team: Customers with Top-Tier Order Values
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    FORMAT(o.TotalAmount, 'C') AS OrderAmount,
    FORMAT(o.OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS OrderDate,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS ProcessedBy
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.e.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
WHERE o.TotalAmount IN (
    SELECT TOP 5 TotalAmount
    FROM Orders
    WHERE IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC
)
  AND c.IsActive = 1
  AND o.IsActive = 1
  AND e.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY o.TotalAmount DESC, o.OrderDate DESC;
```

**Key Learning Points:**
- IN subqueries work with multiple return values
- TOP clause limits results in subquery
- Multiple table JOINs can be combined with subqueries
- Proper filtering ensures data quality

### Solution 2.1: d.DepartmentName Comparison Challenge

```sql
-- Management: High-Performing Employees by d.DepartmentName
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,

    FORMAT((SELECT AVG(e2.e.BaseSalary)
            FROM Employees e e2
            WHERE e2.d.DepartmentID = e.d.DepartmentID
              AND e2.IsActive = 1), 'C') AS DepartmentAverageSalary,
    CAST((e.BaseSalary - (SELECT AVG(e2.e.BaseSalary)
                          FROM Employees e e2
                          WHERE e2.d.DepartmentID = e.d.DepartmentID
                            AND e2.IsActive = 1)) * 100.0 /
         (SELECT AVG(e2.e.BaseSalary)
          FROM Employees e e2
          WHERE e2.d.DepartmentID = e.d.DepartmentID
            AND e2.IsActive = 1) AS DECIMAL(5,1)) AS PercentAboveDeptAverage,
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM Employees e e3
     WHERE e3.d.DepartmentID = e.d.DepartmentID
       AND e3.e.BaseSalary > e.BaseSalary
       AND e3.IsActive = 1) + 1 AS RankInDepartment
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.d.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.BaseSalary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.e.BaseSalary)
    FROM Employees e e2
    WHERE e2.d.DepartmentID = e.d.DepartmentID
      AND e2.IsActive = 1

## Lab Summary and Key Takeaways

### Subquery Performance Best Practices

1. **Indexing Strategy:**
   - Ensure indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses of subqueries
   - Consider composite indexes for correlated subqueries
   - Monitor execution plans for subquery optimization

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Use EXISTS instead of IN when checking for existence
   - Consider JOINs or window functions as alternatives to correlated subqueries
   - Avoid functions in WHERE clauses of subqueries

3. **Business Logic Implementation:**
   - Break complex requirements into smaller, testable subqueries
   - Use meaningful aliases for clarity
   - Document complex business rules in comments

### Common Patterns Learned

- **Scalar subqueries** for single-value comparisons and calculations
- **Correlated subqueries** for row-by-row analysis and ranking
- **EXISTS predicates** for efficient existence testing
- **Complex combinations** for comprehensive business intelligence

### Next Steps

- Practice these patterns with your own business scenarios
- Experiment with query optimization techniques
- Explore window functions as alternatives to subqueries
- Study execution plans to understand performance characteristics
