# Lesson 2: Controlling Transactions

## Overview

Transaction control is essential for managing data consistency, handling errors, and optimizing database performance in enterprise applications. This lesson covers explicit transaction management, savepoints, nested transactions, and advanced transaction control techniques. Understanding how to properly control transactions enables developers to build robust applications that can handle complex business scenarios while maintaining data integrity. For TechCorp's development teams, mastering transaction control is crucial for implementing reliable business processes that span multiple database operations.

## üè¢ TechCorp Business Context

**Advanced Transaction Control Scenarios:**

- **Complex Business Workflows**: Multi-step processes requiring granular control and rollback capabilities
- **Batch Processing Operations**: Large-scale data operations with checkpoint and recovery mechanisms
- **Integration Processes**: Cross-system data synchronization with partial failure handling
- **Financial Operations**: Critical transactions requiring precise control and audit capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic transaction design for high-volume concurrent operations

### üìã TechCorp Database Schema Reference

**Core Tables for Transaction Control Examples:**

```sql
Employees: EmployeeID (3001+), FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary, DepartmentID, ManagerID, HireDate, IsActive
Departments: DepartmentID (2001+), DepartmentName, Budget, Location, IsActive
Projects: ProjectID (4001+), ProjectName, Budget, ProjectManagerID, StartDate, EndDate, IsActive
Orders: OrderID (5001+), CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, IsActive
Customers: CustomerID (6001+), CompanyName, ContactName, City, Country, IsActive
EmployeeProjects: EmployeeID, ProjectID, Role, StartDate, EndDate, HoursWorked, IsActive
TransactionAudit: TransactionID, TransactionType, TableName, RecordID, OldValues, NewValues, Timestamp
```

## 2.1 Explicit Transaction Control

### BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK

Explicit transaction control provides precise management over when transactions start, commit, or rollback.

```sql
-- TechCorp Example: Employee Transfer with Explicit Transaction Control
-- Demonstrates complete control over transaction lifecycle

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_TransferEmployee
    @EmployeeID INT,
    @NewDepartmentID INT,
    @TransferDate DATE = NULL,
    @Reason NVARCHAR(200) = 'Department Transfer'
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    -- Initialize variables
    DECLARE @CurrentDepartmentID INT;
    DECLARE @EmployeeName NVARCHAR(100);
    DECLARE @CurrentSalary DECIMAL(10,2);
    DECLARE @NewDepartmentBudget DECIMAL(15,2);
    DECLARE @TransactionName NVARCHAR(50) = 'EmployeeTransfer_' + CAST(@EmployeeID AS NVARCHAR(10));
    
    SET @TransferDate = ISNULL(@TransferDate, GETDATE());
    
    -- Start explicit transaction
    BEGIN TRANSACTION @TransactionName;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Step 1: Validate employee exists and get current details
        SELECT 
            @CurrentDepartmentID = DepartmentID,

            @CurrentSalary = BaseSalary
        FROM Employees 
        WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID AND IsActive = 1;
        
        IF @CurrentDepartmentID IS NULL
        BEGIN

        END;

        SELECT @NewDepartmentBudget = Budget

        BEGIN
            RAISERROR('Target d.DepartmentName not found or inactive: %d', 16, 1, @NewDepartmentID);
        END;
        
        IF @NewDepartmentBudget < @CurrentSalary
        BEGIN
            RAISERROR('Insufficient budget in target d.DepartmentName for employee BaseSalary', 16, 1);
        END;
        
        -- Step 3: Record transfer in audit table (before making changes)
        INSERT INTO TransactionAudit 
        (TransactionType, TableName, RecordID, OldValues, NewValues, Timestamp, Description)
        VALUES 
        ('EMPLOYEE_TRANSFER', 'Employees', @EmployeeID, 
         'DepartmentID: ' + CAST(@CurrentDepartmentID AS NVARCHAR(10)),
         'DepartmentID: ' + CAST(@NewDepartmentID AS NVARCHAR(10)),

            ModifiedDate = @TransferDate
        WHERE DepartmentID = @CurrentDepartmentID;
        
        -- Step 6: Update new d.DepartmentName budget (allocate budget)
        UPDATE Departments 
        SET Budget = Budget - @CurrentSalary,
            ModifiedDate = @TransferDate
        WHERE DepartmentID = @NewDepartmentID;
        
        -- Step 7: End current project assignments if any
        UPDATE EmployeeProjects 
        SET EndDate = @TransferDate,
            IsActive = 0,
            ModifiedDate = @TransferDate
        WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID 
        AND IsActive = 1
        AND EndDate IS NULL;

## 2.2 Savepoints and Nested Transactions

### Using SAVE TRANSACTION for Granular Control

Savepoints allow partial rollbacks within a transaction, providing fine-grained control over complex operations.

```sql
-- TechCorp Example: Complex Project Setup with Savepoints
-- Demonstrates granular transaction control with multiple rollback points

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE sp_SetupComplexProject

    DECLARE @ProjectSavePoint NVARCHAR(50) = 'ProjectCreated';

            DECLARE @CurrentProjectCount INT;

        END;

        DEALLOCATE team_cursor;
        
        -- Create savepoint after team assignment
        SAVE TRANSACTION @TeamSavePoint;

## Summary

Controlling transactions effectively is essential for building robust, high-performance database applications:

**Transaction Control Mastery:**

- **Explicit Control**: BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK for precise transaction management
- **Savepoints**: Granular rollback capabilities for complex operations with multiple phases
- **Isolation Levels**: Balancing consistency requirements with concurrency performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery strategies with appropriate rollback mechanisms

**Advanced Techniques:**

- **Distributed Transactions**: Coordinating operations across multiple databases and systems
- **Dynamic SQL Integration**: Transaction control with flexible, runtime-generated operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitoring and tuning transaction performance for scalability
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large-scale operations with checkpoint capabilities

**TechCorp Applications:**

- **Business Process Integrity**: Ensuring complex workflows maintain consistency across all steps
- **High-Volume Operations**: Optimizing transaction design for concurrent user scenarios
- **System Integration**: Managing data consistency across multiple enterprise systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Proactive identification and resolution of transaction bottlenecks

**Best Practices Demonstrated:**

- Proper transaction scope and lifetime management
- Strategic use of savepoints for complex operations
- Appropriate isolation level selection for business requirements
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring and optimization techniques

Mastering these transaction control techniques enables TechCorp's development teams to build enterprise applications that handle complex business operations reliably while maintaining optimal performance in multi-user environments.
