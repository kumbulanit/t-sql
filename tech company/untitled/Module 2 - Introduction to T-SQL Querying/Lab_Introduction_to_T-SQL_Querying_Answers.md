SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,  -- 5. SELECT
    e.BaseSalary,
    d.DepartmentName,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.BaseSalary > 70000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN e.BaseSalary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees e                                      -- 1. FROM
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1                                  -- 2. WHERE
  AND e.HireDate >= '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.BaseSalary, d.DepartmentName  -- 3. GROUP BY
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0                                   -- 4. HAVING

```

#### Question 2: Alias Usage Demonstration
**Task:** Show proper and improper alias usage based on logical order.

-- CORRECT: Using alias in ORDER BY (processed after SELECT)
SELECT 
    FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName,
    BaseSalary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY FullName, AnnualSalary;

-- INCORRECT: Cannot use alias in WHERE clause (processed before SELECT)
-- This would cause an error:
-- SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName
-- FROM Employees e
-- WHERE FullName LIKE 'J%';

-- CORRECT: Use the actual expression in WHERE clause
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName + ' ' + LastName LIKE 'J%'
ORDER BY FullName;
```

GROUP BY d.DepartmentName                             -- 3. GROUP BY
HAVING COUNT(e.EmployeeID) >= 2                       -- 4. HAVING
ORDER BY AverageSalary DESC;                          -- 5. ORDER BY
```

#### Question 2: Subquery Processing Order
**Task:** Demonstrate subquery processing in different clauses.

```sql
-- Answer 2: Subquery Processing Order

SELECT FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE BaseSalary > (
    SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) 
    FROM Employees 
    WHERE IsActive = 1
);

-- Subquery in SELECT clause (processed during SELECT phase)
SELECT 
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    BaseSalary,
    (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) FROM Employees e) AS CompanyAverageSalary,
    BaseSalary - (SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) FROM Employees e) AS SalaryDifference
FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1;

-- Correlated subquery example
SELECT 
    e1.FirstName,
    e1.LastName,
    e1.BaseSalary,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM Employees e2 
     WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e1.DepartmentID 
       AND e2.BaseSalary > e1.BaseSalary) AS HigherPaidInDept
FROM Employees e1
WHERE e1.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY e1.DepartmentID, e1.BaseSalary DESC;
```
