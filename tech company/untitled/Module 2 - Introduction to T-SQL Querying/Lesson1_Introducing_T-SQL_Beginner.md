# Lesson 1: Introducing T-SQL - Beginner Lesson

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn (ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETE BEGINNER LEVEL)

Welcome! This lesson introduces you to T-SQL (Transact-SQL) - the language we use to talk to SQL Server databases. Think of it like learning a new language to communicate with your computer's data storage system. No prior experience needed!

## ðŸ“– What is T-SQL?

T-SQL is like having a conversation with your database. It's the language that lets you:

- **Ask questions** about your data ("Show me all employees")
- **Add new information** ("Add this new employee") 
- **Update existing data** ("Change John's salary")
- **Remove old data** ("Delete this old record")

Think of T-SQL as your **data assistant** - it understands exactly what you want and can find it instantly!

## ðŸŽ“ What You'll Be Able to Do

After this lesson, you can:

âœ… Understand what T-SQL is and why it's useful  
âœ… Write your first T-SQL statements  
âœ… Ask basic questions to your database  
âœ… Feel confident starting your SQL journey  

## Part 1: Your First T-SQL Statement ðŸ“Š

### ðŸŽ“ The Simplest T-SQL Ever

Let's start with the easiest possible T-SQL statement - saying hello!

```sql
-- This is your first T-SQL statement
SELECT 'Hello, I am learning T-SQL!' AS MyFirstMessage;
```

**What this does:**
- `SELECT` means "show me"
- The text in quotes is what you want to show
- `AS MyFirstMessage` gives your result a nice column name
- **Result**: You'll see "Hello, I am learning T-SQL!" on your screen

**In plain English**: "SQL Server, please show me this message"

### Exercise 1.1: Try Your First Statement (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Your turn! Try this:
SELECT 'I am practicing T-SQL!' AS Practice;
```

## Part 2: Basic T-SQL Building Blocks ðŸ“Š

### ðŸŽ“ The Main T-SQL Commands

T-SQL has four main types of commands (don't worry, we'll learn them slowly):

1. **SELECT** - Ask questions and get data ("Show me...")
2. **INSERT** - Add new data ("Add this new...")  
3. **UPDATE** - Change existing data ("Change this to...")
4. **DELETE** - Remove data ("Remove this...")

Today we'll focus just on **SELECT** - asking questions!

### Exercise 2.1: Using SELECT with Our Database (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Connect to our TechCorp database
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Ask for basic information
SELECT 'Welcome to TechCorp!' AS WelcomeMessage;
```

### Exercise 2.2: Simple Calculations (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

T-SQL can do math too!

```sql
-- Simple math
SELECT 
    2 + 2 AS Addition,
    10 - 3 AS Subtraction, 
    5 * 4 AS Multiplication,
    20 / 4 AS Division;
```

## Part 3: Getting Information from Tables ðŸ“Š

### ðŸŽ“ What are Tables?

Tables are like spreadsheets that store your company's information. TechCorp has tables for:

- **Employees** (names, salaries, job titles)
- **Departments** (Engineering, Sales, HR, etc.)  
- **Projects** (what projects are happening)
- **Customers** (who buys from TechCorp)

### Exercise 3.1: See What's in the Employees Table (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Look at all employees (just first 5 to keep it simple)
SELECT TOP 5 * 
FROM Employees e;
```

**What this does:**
- `TOP 5` means "just show me the first 5"
- `*` means "show me all columns"
- `FROM Employees e` means "from the Employees table"

### Exercise 3.2: Get Specific Information (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Get just names and job titles  
SELECT TOP 5
    e.FirstName AS [First Name],
    e.LastName AS [Last Name],
    e.JobTitle AS [Job Position]
FROM Employees e;
```

## Part 4: Making Your Queries Look Professional ï¿½

### ðŸŽ“ Adding Comments

Comments help you remember what your code does. Use `--` for comments:

```sql
-- This is a comment - it explains what the code does
-- Comments help you and others understand your work

-- Get employee information for a report
SELECT TOP 3
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS [Full Name],  -- Combine first and last name
    e.JobTitle AS [Position],                        -- Job title
    e.BaseSalary AS [Annual Salary]                  -- How much they earn per year
FROM Employees e;  -- From the employees table
```

### Exercise 4.1: Your Commented Query (ðŸŸ¢ BASIC)

```sql
-- Your turn! Write a query with comments
-- Get department information

SELECT TOP 5
    d.DepartmentName AS [Department],  -- Department name
    d.Budget AS [Budget]               -- Department budget  
FROM Departments d;  -- From departments table
```

## Part 5: Understanding Results ðŸ“Š

### ðŸŽ“ Reading Your Results

When you run T-SQL, you get results in a table format:

| Full Name | Position | Annual Salary |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| John Smith | Engineer | 85000 |
| Jane Doe | Manager | 95000 |

This tells you:
- **Columns**: The information categories (Name, Position, Salary)
- **Rows**: Each person's individual information
- **Values**: The actual data for each person

### Exercise 5.1: Practice Reading Results (ðŸŸ¢ BASIC)

```sql
-- Run this and practice reading the results
SELECT TOP 3
    e.FirstName AS [Name],
    e.JobTitle AS [Job],
    e.HireDate AS [Start Date],
    e.BaseSalary AS [Yearly Pay]
FROM Employees e
ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC;  -- Show highest paid first
```

**Question**: Who has the highest salary in your results?

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Time!

### Exercise 6.1: Your First Real Query (ðŸŸ¢ BEGINNER CHALLENGE)

Create a query that shows:
- Department names
- Department budgets  
- Make the column names friendly
- Show only the first 5 departments
- Add helpful comments

```sql
-- Your solution here:
-- [Try to write this yourself first!]

-- Solution:
-- Department overview report
SELECT TOP 5
    d.DepartmentName AS [Department Name],    -- Name of department
    d.Budget AS [Department Budget],          -- Budget amount
    d.Location AS [Office Location]          -- Where they're located
FROM Departments d;  -- From departments table
```
