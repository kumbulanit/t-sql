## Exercise 1: T-SQL Basics (25 points)

### 1.1 Basic Queries Solutions

**Answer 1.1.1**: Employee Information with Formatting
```sql
SELECT 
    LastName + ', ' + FirstName + 
    CASE 
        WHEN MiddleName IS NOT NULL THEN ' ' + LEFT(MiddleName, 1) + '.'
        ELSE ''
    END AS FullName,
    FORMAT(BaseSalary, 'C', 'en-US') AS FormattedSalary,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
    SUBSTRING(WorkEmail, CHARINDEX('@', WorkEmail) + 1, LEN(WorkEmail)) AS EmailDomain
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;
```

**Explanation**: Uses CASE for NULL handling, FORMAT for currency display, DATEDIFF for tenure calculation, and string functions for email parsing.

**Answer 1.1.2**: Employee BaseSalary Categorization
```sql
SELECT 
    FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS EmployeeName,
    BaseSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN BaseSalary < 55000 THEN 'Entry Level'
        WHEN BaseSalary BETWEEN 55000 AND 75000 THEN 'Mid Level'
        WHEN BaseSalary BETWEEN 75001 AND 90000 THEN 'Senior Level'
        ELSE 'Executive'
    END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees
ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Uses CASE statement with BETWEEN for range categorization, ordered by BaseSalary for easy verification.

**Answer 1.1.3**: Longest Tenure by d.DepartmentName
```sql
WITH EmployeeTenure AS (
    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
        d.DepartmentName,
        DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE()) AS YearsOfService,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY e.DepartmentID ORDER BY e.HireDate ASC) AS TenureRank
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1
)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    EmployeeName,
    YearsOfService
FROM EmployeeTenure
WHERE TenureRank = 1
ORDER BY YearsOfService DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Uses CTE with ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank employees by hire date within each d.DepartmentName, then filters for the most senior employee.

**Answer 1.1.4**: Employees Hired in Same Month
```sql
SELECT 
    DATENAME(MONTH, HireDate) AS HireMonth,
    YEAR(HireDate) AS HireYear,
    FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS EmployeeName,
    HireDate
FROM Employees
WHERE MONTH(HireDate) IN (
    SELECT MONTH(HireDate)
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY MONTH(HireDate)
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
ORDER BY MONTH(HireDate), YEAR(HireDate);
```

**Explanation**: Subquery identifies months with multiple hires, main query shows all employees hired in those months.

**Answer 1.1.5**: Potential WorkEmail Conflicts
```sql
WITH EmailBase AS (
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID,
        FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS EmployeeName,
        LOWER(FirstName + '.' + LastName) AS PotentialEmail,
        WorkEmail
    FROM Employees e
)
SELECT 
    eb1.EmployeeName AS Employee1,
    eb2.EmployeeName AS Employee2,
    eb1.PotentialEmail AS ConflictingEmailPattern
FROM EmailBase eb1
INNER JOIN EmailBase eb2 ON eb1.PotentialEmail = eb2.PotentialEmail
    AND eb1.EmployeeID < eb2.EmployeeID
ORDER BY eb1.PotentialEmail;
```

**Explanation**: Self-join on potential email patterns to find conflicts, using inequality to avoid duplicate pairs.

## Exercise 2: Set Operations and Logic (30 points)

### 2.1 Set Operations Solutions

**Answer 2.1.1**: Departments by Budget or BaseSalary Criteria
```sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName, 'High Budget' AS Reason
FROM Departments
WHERE Budget > 300000

UNION

SELECT d.DepartmentName, 'High Average BaseSalary' AS Reason
FROM Departments d
WHERE d.DepartmentID IN (
    SELECT e.DepartmentID
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1
    GROUP BY e.DepartmentID
    HAVING AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 70000
)
ORDER BY DepartmentIDName;
```

**Explanation**: UNION combines departments meeting either criteria, with reason codes to explain inclusion.

**Answer 2.1.2**: Employee Project IsActive Alignment
```sql
-- Employees in IT working on "In Progress" projects
SELECT e.EmployeeID
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE e.DepartmentID = 1 AND p.IsActive = 'In Progress'

INTERSECT

-- Employees in Marketing working on "Completed" projects
SELECT e.EmployeeID
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE e.DepartmentID = 4 AND p.IsActive = 'Completed';
```

**Explanation**: INTERSECT finds employees whose project assignments align with d.DepartmentName expectations.

**Answer 2.1.3**: Well-Funded But Unassigned Employees
```sql
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    d.DepartmentName,
    d.Budget,
    'Potential underutilization' AS ManagementConcern
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.DepartmentID IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Budget > 250000
)

EXCEPT

SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName,
    d.DepartmentName,
    d.Budget,
    'Potential underutilization'
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID;
```

**Explanation**: EXCEPT identifies employees in well-funded departments who aren't assigned to projects.

**Answer 2.1.4**: Employee Project Participation Categories
```sql
-- Project Leaders (2+ projects)
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    'Project Leader' AS Category
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.EmployeeID IN (
    SELECT EmployeeID 
    FROM EmployeeProjects 
    GROUP BY EmployeeID 
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
)

UNION

-- Contributors (exactly 1 project)
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName,
    'Contributor'
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.EmployeeID IN (
    SELECT EmployeeID 
    FROM EmployeeProjects 
    GROUP BY EmployeeID 
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)

UNION

-- Available (no projects)
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName,
    'Available'
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.EmployeeID NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT EmployeeID FROM EmployeeProjects
)
ORDER BY Category, EmployeeName;
```

**Explanation**: Multiple categories combined with UNION, using aggregation and NOT IN for different participation levels.

**Answer 2.1.5**: Skill Gap Analysis (Conceptual)
```sql
-- Assuming a Skills table exists, this would identify gaps
WITH ProjectRequiredSkills AS (
    -- Hypothetical: projects require certain skills
    SELECT ProjectID, 'Database Design' AS RequiredSkill FROM Projects WHERE ProjectName LIKE '%ERP%'
    UNION
    SELECT ProjectID, 'Web Development' FROM Projects WHERE ProjectName LIKE '%Website%'
),
EmployeeActualSkills AS (
    -- Hypothetical: employee actual skills
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, 'Database Design' AS Skill
    FROM Employees e WHERE e.DepartmentID = 1
    UNION
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, 'Web Development'
    FROM Employees e WHERE e.JobTitle LIKE '%Developer%'
)
-- Find employees on projects lacking required skills
SELECT DISTINCT e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS Employee, 
       p.ProjectName,
       prs.RequiredSkill
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
INNER JOIN ProjectRequiredSkills prs ON p.ProjectID = prs.ProjectID
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM EmployeeActualSkills eas 
    WHERE eas.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID 
    AND eas.Skill = prs.RequiredSkill
);
```

**Explanation**: Demonstrates set operations for identifying mismatches between required and actual skills.

### 2.2 Complex Predicates Solutions

**Answer 2.2.1**: Complex Multi-Criteria Employee Filter
```sql
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.HireDate,
    e.BaseSalary,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.MiddleName,
    e.JobTitle
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND (e.HireDate > '2020-12-31' OR e.BaseSalary > 80000)
  AND d.Budget > 200000
  AND (e.MiddleName IS NULL OR e.JobTitle LIKE '%Director%')
ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Complex AND/OR logic with NULL handling and pattern matching, demonstrating predicate precedence.

**Answer 2.2.2**: Departments with Above-Average Employees and Projects
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d.DepartmentName
FROM Departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    -- At least one employee earns more than d.DepartmentName average
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employees e1
    WHERE e1.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      AND e1.BaseSalary > (
          SELECT AVG(e2.BaseSalary)
          FROM Employees e2
          WHERE e2.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      )
)
AND EXISTS (
    -- At least one project assigned to d.DepartmentName employees
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
)
AND d.Budget > (
    -- Budget justified by employee cost
    SELECT SUM(e.BaseSalary) * 1.5  -- 50% overhead assumption
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
);
```

**Explanation**: Multiple EXISTS clauses with correlated subqueries testing different business conditions.

**Answer 2.2.3**: Resource Allocation Issues Identification
```sql
-- Projects with no employee assignments
SELECT p.ProjectName, 'No employees assigned' AS Issue
FROM Projects p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM EmployeeProjects ep 
    WHERE ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
)

UNION

-- Departments with no active projects
SELECT d.DepartmentName + ' Department', 'No active projects'
FROM Departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      AND p.IsActive = 'In Progress'
)

UNION

-- High-budget departments with low utilization
SELECT d.DepartmentName + ' Department', 'High budget, low utilization'
FROM Departments d
WHERE d.Budget > 300000
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Employees e
      INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
      WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      GROUP BY e.DepartmentID
      HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
  );
```

**Explanation**: NOT EXISTS pattern for identifying various resource allocation gaps.

## Exercise 3: Logical Order Understanding (25 points)

### 3.1 Processing Order Analysis Solutions

**Answer 3.1.1**: Query Analysis and Fix
```sql
-- PROBLEM: 'TeamSize' column doesn't exist and is used in WHERE before being defined

-- INCORRECT QUERY ISSUES:
-- 1. 'TeamSize' is not a column in any table
-- 2. Even if it were an alias, it can't be used in WHERE clause
-- 3. Logical order: FROM -> JOIN -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY

-- CORRECTED VERSION:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, 
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) as AvgSal,
    COUNT(*) as TeamSize
FROM Departments d
JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1  -- Use actual column in WHERE
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2   -- Use HAVING for aggregate conditions
   AND AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 60000
ORDER BY AvgSal DESC;
```

**Explanation**: 
- **Processing Order**: FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY
- **Error**: TeamSize used in WHERE but not yet calculated
- **Fix**: Move aggregate condition to HAVING, add WHERE for row-level filtering

**Answer 3.1.2**: Alias Scope Issue Analysis and Fix
```sql
-- PROBLEM: 'Category' alias used in WHERE clause before SELECT processing

-- INCORRECT QUERY ISSUES:
-- 1. Aliases created in SELECT are not available in WHERE clause
-- 2. 'ProjectCount' alias similarly not available in WHERE
-- 3. Logical processing order prevents this usage

-- CORRECTED VERSION - Option 1 (Subquery):
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID,
        FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName,
        ISNULL(ProjectCount, 0) AS ProjectCount,
        CASE WHEN ISNULL(ProjectCount, 0) > 1 THEN 'Multi-Project' ELSE 'Single-Project' END AS Category
    FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT EmployeeID, COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount
        FROM EmployeeProjects 
        GROUP BY EmployeeID
    ) p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID
) emp_with_category
WHERE Category = 'Multi-Project'
ORDER BY ProjectCount DESC;

-- CORRECTED VERSION - Option 2 (CTE):
WITH EmployeeProjects AS (
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID,
        FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName,
        ISNULL(ProjectCount, 0) AS ProjectCount,
        CASE WHEN ISNULL(ProjectCount, 0) > 1 THEN 'Multi-Project' ELSE 'Single-Project' END AS Category
    FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT EmployeeID, COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount
        FROM EmployeeProjects 
        GROUP BY EmployeeID
    ) p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID
)
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeProjects
WHERE Category = 'Multi-Project'
ORDER BY ProjectCount DESC;
```

**Explanation**: 
- **Issue**: Aliases created in SELECT not available in WHERE
- **Solution**: Use subquery or CTE to make aliases available for filtering
- **Processing Order**: Inner query completes before outer query WHERE clause

**Answer 3.1.3**: WHERE vs HAVING Demonstration
```sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.HireDate > '2020-12-31'  -- WHERE: filters individual rows before grouping
  AND e.IsActive = 1             -- WHERE: row-level filter
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 65000;    -- HAVING: filters groups after aggregation

-- EXPLANATION OF FILTER PLACEMENT:
-- WHERE filters are applied to individual rows BEFORE grouping
-- - e.HireDate > '2020-12-31': filters employees hired after 2020
-- - e.IsActive = 1: filters only active employees
-- These filters reduce the dataset before expensive grouping operations

-- HAVING filters are applied to grouped results AFTER aggregation
-- - AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 65000: filters departments based on calculated average
-- This filter can only work after the GROUP BY creates d.DepartmentName groups
```

**Explanation**:
- **WHERE**: Filters individual rows before grouping (more efficient)
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after aggregation (necessary for aggregate conditions)
- **Performance**: WHERE reduces rows early, improving GROUP BY performance

        CASE 
            WHEN SUM(ep.HoursAllocated) > 0 
            THEN ROUND(SUM(ep.HoursWorked) * 100.0 / SUM(ep.HoursAllocated), 1)
            ELSE 0 
        END AS UtilizationPercent
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
    GROUP BY e.DepartmentID
),
DepartmentRanking AS (
    SELECT 
        dm.*,
        ISNULL(ru.TotalHoursAllocated, 0) AS TotalHoursAllocated,
        ISNULL(ru.TotalHoursWorked, 0) AS TotalHoursWorked,
        ISNULL(ru.UtilizationPercent, 0) AS UtilizationPercent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY 
            CASE WHEN dm.EmployeeCount > 0 THEN ru.UtilizationPercent ELSE 0 END DESC,
            dm.AvgSalary DESC
        ) AS ProductivityRank,
        CASE 
            WHEN dm.EmployeeCount = 0 THEN 'No Active Employees'
            WHEN dm.ProjectCount = 0 THEN 'No Project Assignments'
            WHEN ISNULL(ru.UtilizationPercent, 0) < 70 THEN 'Low Utilization'
            WHEN dm.TotalSalaryCost > dm.Budget * 0.8 THEN 'High BaseSalary Burden'
            ELSE 'Good Performance'
        END AS AttentionFlag
    FROM DepartmentMetrics dm
    LEFT JOIN ResourceUtilization ru ON dm.DepartmentID = ru.DepartmentID
)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    EmployeeCount,
    FORMAT(AvgSalary, 'C0') AS AvgSalary,
    ProjectCount,
    TotalHoursAllocated,
    TotalHoursWorked,
    UtilizationPercent,
    ProductivityRank,
    AttentionFlag
FROM DepartmentRanking
ORDER BY ProductivityRank;
```

**Explanation**: Multi-CTE approach calculating d.DepartmentName metrics, resource utilization, and providing management insights with ranking and attention flags.

**Answer 4.1.2**: Employee Career Path Analysis
```sql

**Business Logic Explanation**:

1. **Overallocation Detection**: Employees working >110% of allocated hours
2. **Underutilization**: Employees working <80% of allocated hours  
3. **Project Risk**: Projects <75% complete flagged as behind schedule
4. **Priority System**: 
   - Priority 1: Immediate risks (overallocation, behind projects)
   - Priority 2: Optimization opportunities (underutilization)
   - Priority 3: Available resources (unassigned employees)

**Performance Considerations**:
- Uses CTEs for modular, readable code
- Aggregations grouped efficiently
- Results structured for management action

**Actionable Insights**:
- Clear priority ranking for management decisions
- Quantified impact (hours variance) for resource planning
- Department-level analysis for strategic decisions
- Specific recommendations for each identified issue

This solution demonstrates mastery of T-SQL concepts while providing real business value through actionable resource optimization insights.
