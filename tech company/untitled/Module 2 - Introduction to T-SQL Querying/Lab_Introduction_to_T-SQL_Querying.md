In Module 1, we created the TechCorpDB database and explored SQL Server architecture. Now in Module 2, we'll build the core business tables for TechCorp Solutions and learn T-SQL fundamentals by querying real business data.

**Prerequisites:**
- TechCorpDB database created in Module 1
- Understanding of SQL Server architecture from Module 1

```sql
-- Connect to our TechCorp database from Module 1
USE TechCorpDB;
GO

-- Verify we're in the right database
SELECT 
    DB_NAME() as CurrentDatabase,
    'Module 2 - T-SQL Fundamentals' as ModuleTitle,
    GETDATE() as LabStartTime;
```

### TechCorp Business Schema (Module 2 Foundation)

## Lab Exercises

### Section 1: Your First T-SQL Queries! (ðŸŸ¢ BEGINNER LEVEL)

**ðŸŽ“ TUTORIAL: What is a SELECT Query?**

A SELECT query is like asking a question of your database. Think of it like this:
- **You ask**: "Show me all employees in TechCorp"  
- **SQL Server responds**: Shows you a table with employee information
- **The magic word**: SELECT tells SQL Server you want to see data (not change it)

#### Exercise 1.1: Simple SELECT Statements (ðŸŸ¢ ABSOLUTE BEGINNER)

**What you'll learn**: How to ask the database to show you information

**Why this matters**: This is the foundation of everything else - 90% of what you do with databases is asking questions with SELECT

**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**

**Query #1: See All TechCorp Employees (Start Here!)**
```sql
-- Your first real business query!
-- This shows you everyone who works at TechCorp
SELECT * FROM Employees e;
```

**ðŸ’¡ What This Means:**
- `SELECT` = "Show me..."
- `*` = "...everything..." (all columns)  
- `FROM Employees` = "...from the Employees table"
- `;` = End of command (like a period in a sentence)

**Query #2: See Specific Information Only**
```sql
-- Sometimes you don't need all information - just the basics
SELECT 
    FirstName,
    LastName, 
    JobTitle,
    BaseSalary
FROM Employees e;
```

**ðŸ’¡ What This Means:**
- Instead of `*` (everything), we list exactly what we want to see
- This is better because it's faster and easier to read
- Notice we can split the query across multiple lines for readability

**Query #3: Create Your Own Columns with Calculations**
```sql
-- Let's do some business math - calculate monthly salaries
SELECT 
    FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName,    -- Combine first and last name
    BaseSalary,                                -- Annual BaseSalary  
    BaseSalary / 12 AS MonthlySalary,         -- Calculate monthly BaseSalary
    JobTitle
FROM Employees e;
```

**ðŸ’¡ What This Means:**
- `FirstName + ' ' + LastName` = Combines text together (called "concatenation")
- `AS FullName` = Give this new column a name
- `BaseSalary / 12` = Basic math - divide annual BaseSalary by 12 months
- You can create new columns that don't exist in the original table!

**ðŸŽ¯ Success Check**: You should see:
1. A list of all employees (Query #1)
2. Just the basic info for each employee (Query #2)  
3. Full names and monthly BaseSalary calculations (Query #3)

**ðŸš« Common Beginner Mistakes:**
- Forgetting the semicolon (;) at the end
- Misspelling table or column names (use exact spelling!)  
- Forgetting commas between column names
- **Don't worry** - everyone makes these mistakes at first!
   - Full name in uppercase

5. **Date Functions**: Create a query showing:
   - Employee name
   - Hire date
   - Years of service (from hire date to current date)
   - Hire year

#### Exercise 1.2: Filtering Data
Write queries to:

1. Find all employees with BaseSalary greater than $70,000.

2. Find all employees hired after January 1, 2021.

3. Find all employees in the IT d.DepartmentName (DepartmentID = 1).

4. Find all employees whose first name starts with 'J'.

5. Find all employees with a middle name.

6. Find all active employees with BaseSalary between $50,000 and $80,000.

#### Exercise 1.3: Advanced Filtering
Write queries to:

1. Find employees whose email contains 'gmail' or 'company'.

2. Find employees hired in 2021 or 2022.

3. Find employees with BaseSalary > $60,000 AND (in IT OR Marketing departments).

4. Find employees whose last name ends with 'son' or 'er'.

### Section 2: Set Operations (Lesson 2)

#### Exercise 2.1: Basic Set Operations
Write queries to:

1. **UNION**: Get a list of all first names from both Employees and a hypothetical Customers table (use Employees twice with different filters).

2. **INTERSECT**: Find d.DepartmentName IDs that have both high-BaseSalary employees (>$70k) and low-BaseSalary employees (<$60k).

3. **EXCEPT**: Find employees who are not assigned to any projects.

#### Exercise 2.2: Set Membership
Write queries to:

1. Find employees whose d.DepartmentName ID is in the list (1, 3, 5).

2. Find employees who work on projects with status 'In Progress'.

3. Find departments that have employees (using EXISTS).

4. Find employees who are not managers (not in ManagerID column of other employees).

#### Exercise 2.3: Advanced Set Operations
Write queries to:

1. Find employees who work on ALL active projects.

2. Create a report showing employees who work on the same projects as employee with ID 2.

3. Find departments where ALL employees earn more than $55,000.

### Section 3: Predicate Logic (Lesson 3)

#### Exercise 3.1: NULL Handling
Write queries to:

1. Find employees with no middle name.

2. Find employees where middle name is either NULL or empty string.

3. Create a report showing full names, handling NULL middle names gracefully.

4. Find employees whose manager ID is NULL (top-level managers).

#### Exercise 3.2: Complex Predicates
Write queries to:

1. Find employees where (BaseSalary > $70k AND d.DepartmentName is IT) OR (BaseSalary > $80k).

2. Find projects that are either completed OR have a budget > $100k.

3. Find employees hired in Q1 of any year (January-March).

4. Find employees whose title contains 'Director' or 'Manager'.

#### Exercise 3.3: Advanced Pattern Matching
Write queries to:

1. Find employees with exactly 5-character first names.

2. Find employees whose email follows the pattern: firstname.lastname@company.com.

3. Find projects with names containing exactly two words.

### Section 4: Logical Order of Operations (Lesson 4)

#### Exercise 4.1: Understanding Processing Order
For each query, explain the logical processing order:

1. ```sql
   SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(e.BaseSalary) as AvgSalary
   FROM Employees
   WHERE IsActive = 1
   GROUP BY DepartmentIDID
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
   ORDER BY AvgSalary DESC;
   ```

2. ```sql
   SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
   FROM Employees e
   JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
   WHERE e.BaseSalary > 60000
   ORDER BY d.DepartmentName;
   ```

#### Exercise 4.2: Alias Usage
Identify what's wrong with these queries and fix them:

1. ```sql
   SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName, BaseSalary
   FROM Employees
   WHERE FullName LIKE 'John%';
   ```

2. ```sql
   SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmpCount
   FROM Employees
   WHERE EmpCount > 2
   GROUP BY DepartmentIDID;
   ```

#### Exercise 4.3: WHERE vs HAVING
Write queries using appropriate filtering:

1. Find departments with more than 2 employees, showing only active employees.

2. Find employees in departments where the average BaseSalary is > $65,000.

3. Show d.DepartmentName statistics, but only for departments with budget > $250,000.

### Section 5: Comprehensive Challenges

#### Challenge 1: d.DepartmentName Analysis
Create a comprehensive d.DepartmentName report showing:
- d.DepartmentName name
- Number of active employees
- Average BaseSalary
- Highest and lowest salaries
- Number of ongoing projects
- Total project budget
Only include departments with at least 2 employees.

#### Challenge 2: Employee Performance Analysis
Create a report showing:
- Employee name and title
- d.DepartmentName name
- Number of projects assigned
- Total hours allocated vs hours worked
- Performance ratio (hours worked / hours allocated)
- Whether they're ahead, behind, or on track

#### Challenge 3: Hierarchical Analysis
Create a query that shows:
- Manager name
- Number of direct reports
- Average BaseSalary of direct reports
- Highest-paid direct report
- Only show managers with at least 2 direct reports

#### Challenge 4: Project Resource Analysis
Create a analysis showing:
- Project name and status
- Number of employees assigned
- Total hours allocated
- Total hours worked
- Percentage completion
- Whether project is over or under allocated
