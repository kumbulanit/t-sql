# Lab: Practice Your Data Counting and Grouping Skills - Beginner Lab

## üéØ Practice What You've Learned (üü¢ COMPLETE BEGINNER LEVEL)

Welcome to your practice lab! This lab is designed for complete beginners who want to practice the basics of counting, adding, and grouping data. No experience necessary - just follow along and try each exercise.

## üìñ What You'll Practice

In this lab, you will practice:

- **Counting things** in your database
- **Adding up numbers** (like salaries and budgets)  
- **Finding averages** and extremes (highest/lowest)
- **Grouping data** by categories
- **Filtering groups** to show only what you want
- **Answering simple business questions** with data

## üéì Before You Start

Make sure you understand these basic concepts:

‚úÖ **COUNT(*)** = Count how many things you have  
‚úÖ **SUM(column)** = Add up all the numbers in a column  
‚úÖ **AVG(column)** = Find the average (typical) number  
‚úÖ **GROUP BY** = Sort data into groups (like by department)  
‚úÖ **HAVING** = Filter out groups you don't want to see  

Don't worry if you need to look back at the lessons - that's normal!

## Section 1: Basic Counting Practice üìä

Let's start with simple counting exercises.

### Exercise 1.1: Count Everything (üü¢ SUPER EASY)

**Goal**: Practice counting different things in the database.

```sql
-- Connect to the database first
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Exercise 1.1a: How many employees work at TechCorp?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees 
FROM Employees e;

-- Exercise 1.1b: How many projects does TechCorp have?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalProjects
FROM Projects p;

-- Exercise 1.1c: How many clients does TechCorp serve?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalClients
FROM Clients;

-- Exercise 1.1d: How many departments exist?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalDepartments  
FROM Departments;
```

**Expected Results**: You should get four different numbers - one for each table.

### Exercise 1.2: Your Turn to Count (üü¢ EASY)

Try writing these counting queries yourself:

```sql
-- Challenge 1.2a: Count how many different job levels exist
-- Hint: Use COUNT(*) and the Employees table, look at JobLevel column
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT JobLevel) AS NumberOfJobLevels
FROM Employees e;

-- Challenge 1.2b: Count projects that have started (StartDate is not null)  
-- Hint: Use WHERE StartDate IS NOT NULL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ProjectsStarted
FROM Projects p
WHERE StartDate IS NOT NULL;
```

## Section 2: Adding and Averaging Practice üìä

### Exercise 2.1: Simple Math with Money (üü¢ EASY)

**Goal**: Practice adding up salaries and budgets.

```sql
-- Exercise 2.1a: What's the total e.BaseSalary expense for all employees?
SELECT SUM(e.BaseSalary) AS TotalPayroll
FROM Employees e;

-- Exercise 2.1b: What's the total value of all projects?  
SELECT SUM(Budget) AS TotalProjectValue
FROM Projects p;

-- Exercise 2.1c: What's the average employee e.BaseSalary?
SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AverageBaseSalary
FROM Employees e;

-- Exercise 2.1d: What's the average project size?
SELECT AVG(Budget) AS AverageProjectSize  
FROM Projects p;
```

### Exercise 2.2: Find the Extremes (üü¢ EASY)

**Goal**: Find the highest and lowest values.

```sql
-- Exercise 2.2a: What's the highest and lowest e.BaseSalary?
SELECT 
    MAX(e.BaseSalary) AS HighestBaseSalary,
    MIN(e.BaseSalary) AS LowestBaseSalary
FROM Employees e;

-- Exercise 2.2b: What's the biggest and smallest project budget?
SELECT 
    MAX(Budget) AS LargestProject,
    MIN(Budget) AS SmallestProject  
FROM Projects p;
```

### Exercise 2.3: Complete Summary Reports (üü¢ EASY)

**Goal**: Get all statistics in one query.

```sql
-- Exercise 2.3a: Complete employee summary
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
    SUM(e.BaseSalary) AS TotalPayroll, 
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AverageBaseSalary,
    MIN(e.BaseSalary) AS LowestBaseSalary,
    MAX(e.BaseSalary) AS HighestBaseSalary
FROM Employees e;

-- Exercise 2.3b: Complete project summary
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalProjects,
    SUM(Budget) AS TotalBudget,
    AVG(Budget) AS AverageBudget, 
    MIN(Budget) AS SmallestBudget,
    MAX(Budget) AS LargestBudget
FROM Projects p;
```

## Section 3: Basic Grouping Practice üìä

Now let's practice organizing data into groups.

### Exercise 3.1: Simple Grouping (üü¢ EASY)

**Goal**: Count things by category.

```sql
-- Exercise 3.1a: How many employees are in each department?
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
ORDER BY AverageSalary DESC;

-- Exercise 3.3b: Average project size by status  
SELECT 
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount,
    AVG(Budget) AS AverageProjectSize
FROM Projects p  
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY AverageProjectSize DESC;
```

## Section 4: Filtering Groups Practice üìä

Now let's practice showing only the groups we care about.

### Exercise 4.1: Filter by Count (üü¢ EASY)

**Goal**: Show only groups that have enough items.

```sql
-- Exercise 4.1a: Show only departments with more than 2 employees
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 45000
ORDER BY AverageSalary DESC;

-- Exercise 4.3b: Show project statuses with average budget above $25,000
SELECT 
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount,
    AVG(Budget) AS AverageProjectSize
FROM Projects p
GROUP BY Status
HAVING AVG(Budget) > 25000  
ORDER BY AverageProjectSize DESC;
```

## Section 5: Real Business Questions üìä

Let's answer questions that a real manager might ask.

### Exercise 5.1: Employee Questions (üü¢ INTERMEDIATE)

```sql
-- Question 5.1a: "Which departments have both many employees AND high costs?"
-- (More than 2 employees AND total salaries over $150,000)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName, JobLevel  
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, JobLevel;

-- Challenge 6.2b: "Project activity by year and status"
SELECT 
    YEAR(StartDate) AS ProjectYear,
    Status,
    COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount,
    AVG(Budget) AS AverageProjectSize
FROM Projects p
WHERE StartDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY YEAR(StartDate), Status
ORDER BY ProjectYear, Status;
```

### Challenge 6.3: Business Intelligence Report (üü¢ CHALLENGING)

```sql
-- Challenge 6.3: "Create a comprehensive business overview"
-- This query combines multiple concepts to create a business dashboard
SELECT 
    'TechCorp Business Overview' AS ReportSection,
    'Employee Statistics' AS Category,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees e) AS TotalEmployees,
    (SELECT FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') FROM Employees e) AS AvgSalary,
    (SELECT FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') FROM Employees e) AS TotalPayroll
    
UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TechCorp Business Overview' AS ReportSection,
    'Project Statistics' AS Category, 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Projects p) AS TotalProjects,
    (SELECT FORMAT(AVG(Budget), 'C0') FROM Projects p) AS AvgProjectSize,
    (SELECT FORMAT(SUM(Budget), 'C0') FROM Projects p) AS TotalProjectValue
    
UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TechCorp Business Overview' AS ReportSection,
    'Client Statistics' AS Category,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Clients) AS TotalClients,
    'N/A' AS AvgValue,  
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Industry) FROM Clients) AS TotalIndustries;
```
