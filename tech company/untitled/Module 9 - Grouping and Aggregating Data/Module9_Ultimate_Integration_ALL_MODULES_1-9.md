# PART 1: MODULE 1 + MODULE 9 - Database Architecture + Aggregation

## 🏗️ What You Learned in Module 1
- **SQL Server Architecture** - How databases store and organize information
- **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)** - Your main tool for working with databases
- **Database Components** - Tables, columns, rows, and relationships
- **TechCorpDB Setup** - Creating and connecting to your practice database

## 🔗 How Module 1 Connects to Module 9

### Understanding WHERE Your Aggregate Data Lives

**Module 1 Concept**: Databases store information in tables  
**Module 9 Addition**: Aggregate functions work across all rows in those tables

```sql
-- Module 1: Connect to database and understand structure
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Show which database you're working with (Module 1 skill)
SELECT 
    DB_NAME() as CurrentDatabase,
    'Module 9 Practice' as Purpose,
    GETDATE() as SessionStartTime;

-- Module 9: Now count all the data in that database
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees,
    'This counts every row in the Employees table' as Explanation
FROM Employees e;
```

### Exercise 1.1: Database Performance + Aggregation (🟢 BASIC)

**Business Question**: "How efficiently is our database performing with aggregate queries?"

```sql
-- Use Module 1 knowledge: Check database info
-- Use Module 9 knowledge: Count and analyze data

SELECT 
    -- Database information (Module 1)
    DB_NAME() as DatabaseName,
    @@SERVERNAME as ServerName,
    
    -- Data summary (Module 9)
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees e) as TotalEmployees,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Projects) as TotalProjects,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Clients) as TotalClients,
    
    -- Performance insight
    'Database contains ' + CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees e) AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' employees' as Summary;
```

**Real-World Application**: Database administrators use this type of query to monitor database size and performance.

### Exercise 1.2: SSMS + Data Exploration (🟢 BASIC)

**Using SSMS (Module 1) to explore aggregate data (Module 9):**

```sql
-- Step 1: In SSMS Object Explorer, expand TechCorpDB > Tables
-- Step 2: Right-click Employees table > Select Top 1000 Rows
-- Step 3: Now run aggregate analysis:

SELECT 
    'Table Analysis' as ReportType,
    COUNT(*) as RowCount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Department) as UniqueDepartments,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') as AverageSalary
FROM Employees e;

-- Step 4: Compare with other tables
SELECT 
    'Projects' as TableName,
    COUNT(*) as RowCount,
    FORMAT(SUM(Budget), 'C0') as TotalBudget
FROM Projects
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Clients' as TableName,
    COUNT(*) as RowCount,
    FORMAT(AVG(ContractValue), 'C0') as AverageContract
FROM Clients;
```

# PART 2: MODULE 2 + MODULE 9 - T-SQL Fundamentals + Aggregation

## 📝 What You Learned in Module 2
- **T-SQL Syntax** - The language SQL Server understands
- **Basic SELECT statements** - Asking questions of your data
- **Data types** - Numbers, text, dates, and more
- **Comments and formatting** - Writing clear, readable code

## 🔗 How Module 2 Connects to Module 9

### Proper T-SQL Syntax for Aggregate Functions

**Module 2 Concept**: Every T-SQL statement has proper syntax  
**Module 9 Addition**: Aggregate functions follow the same syntax rules

```sql
-- Module 2: Proper T-SQL formatting and comments
-- Module 9: Using aggregate functions with good syntax

-- ================================
-- EMPLOYEE BaseSalary ANALYSIS
-- Combining T-SQL fundamentals with aggregation
-- ================================

SELECT 
    -- Basic count (Module 9)
    COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
    
    -- Formatted money (Module 2 + Module 9)
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(MIN(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS LowestBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(MAX(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS HighestBaseSalary,
    
    -- Business calculation (Module 2 + Module 9)
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS TotalPayrollCost
FROM Employees e;

-- T-SQL best practices from Module 2:
-- 1. Use clear column aliases
-- 2. Add helpful comments
-- 3. Format code for readability
-- 4. End statements with semicolons
```

### Exercise 2.1: T-SQL Variables + Aggregation (🟢 BASIC)

**Business Question**: "What percentage of our employees earn above average BaseSalary?"

```sql
-- Declare variables (Module 2 skill)
DECLARE @AverageSalary DECIMAL(10,2);
DECLARE @TotalEmployees INT;
DECLARE @HighEarners INT;

-- Calculate aggregates and store in variables (Module 9 skill)
SELECT @AverageSalary = AVG(e.BaseSalary) FROM Employees e;
SELECT @TotalEmployees = COUNT(*) FROM Employees e;
SELECT @HighEarners = COUNT(*) FROM Employees WHERE BaseSalary > @AverageSalary;

-- Display results with T-SQL formatting
SELECT 
    'BaseSalary Analysis Report' AS ReportTitle,
    FORMAT(@AverageSalary, 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    @TotalEmployees AS TotalEmployees,
    @HighEarners AS EmployeesAboveAverage,
    FORMAT((@HighEarners * 100.0 / @TotalEmployees), 'N1') + '%' AS PercentageAboveAverage;
```

### Exercise 2.2: T-SQL Data Types + GROUP BY (🟢 BASIC)

```sql
-- Working with different data types in aggregation
SELECT d.DepartmentName,                          -- NVARCHAR data type
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,          -- INT result
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AverageBaseSalary,       -- DECIMAL result
    MIN(HireDate) AS FirstHireDate,     -- DATE result
    MAX(HireDate) AS LastHireDate       -- DATE result
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
ORDER BY AVG(e.BaseSalary) DESC;

-- T-SQL comment: This shows how Module 2 data types work with Module 9 aggregation
```

    COUNT(*) AS EmployeesHired,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AvgStartingSalary,
    
    -- Calculate tenure for current employees (Module 6 + Module 9)
    AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS AvgYearsOfService,
    MIN(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS MinYearsOfService,
    MAX(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS MaxYearsOfService
    
FROM Employees
WHERE HireDate IS NOT NULL              -- Handle NULLs (Module 6)

ORDER BY YEAR(HireDate), MONTH(HireDate);  -- Sort chronologically
```

### Exercise 6.2: String Data Analysis (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

```sql
-- Module 6: String data types and functions
-- Module 9: Aggregating string data

SELECT 
    -- String analysis
    LEN(FirstName) AS NameLength,         -- String length (Module 6)
    
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(FirstName) <= 4 THEN 'Short Name'
        WHEN LEN(FirstName) <= 7 THEN 'Medium Name'
        ELSE 'Long Name'
    END AS NameCategory,
    
    -- Aggregate by name length category
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AvgSalary,
    
    -- String aggregation examples
    MIN(FirstName) AS FirstAlphabetically,
    MAX(FirstName) AS LastAlphabetically
    
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName IS NOT NULL            -- Handle NULL strings (Module 6)
  AND LEN(TRIM(FirstName)) > 0        -- Exclude empty strings (Module 6)
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(FirstName) <= 4 THEN 'Short Name'
        WHEN LEN(FirstName) <= 7 THEN 'Medium Name'
        ELSE 'Long Name'
    END
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### Exercise 6.3: NULL Handling in Aggregation (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

**Business Question**: "How do missing values affect our data analysis?"

```sql
-- Module 6: Proper NULL handling
-- Module 9: How aggregates handle NULLs

SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    
    -- Count variations (Module 6 + Module 9)
    COUNT(*) AS TotalRows,                    -- Counts all rows including NULLs
    COUNT(BaseSalary) AS EmployeesWithSalary,     -- Counts only non-NULL salaries
    COUNT(PhoneNumber) AS EmployeesWithPhone, -- Counts only non-NULL phone numbers
    
    -- NULL analysis
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(BaseSalary) AS MissingSalaries,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(PhoneNumber) AS MissingPhones,
    
    -- Percentage calculations
    FORMAT(
        (COUNT(BaseSalary) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 'N1'
    ) + '%' AS SalaryDataCompleteness,
    
    -- Safe aggregation (handles NULLs properly)
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AvgSalary,           -- AVG ignores NULLs
    FORMAT(ISNULL(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 0), 'C0') AS AvgSalarySafe,  -- Convert NULL result to 0
    
    -- Conditional aggregation
    AVG(CASE WHEN BaseSalary IS NOT NULL THEN BaseSalary END) AS AvgSalaryExplicit
    
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

# PART 8: MODULE 8 + MODULE 9 - Built-in Functions + Aggregation

## 🛠️ What You Learned in Module 8
- **String functions** - UPPER, LOWER, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING
- **Date functions** - YEAR, MONTH, DATEDIFF, DATEADD
- **Math functions** - ROUND, CEILING, ABS
- **Conversion functions** - CAST, CONVERT, FORMAT

## 🔗 How Module 8 Connects to Module 9

### Functions Enhance Aggregation

**Module 8 Concept**: Functions transform data  
**Module 9 Addition**: Use functions within aggregation for powerful analysis

```sql
-- Module 8 + Module 9: Functions working with aggregation
SELECT 
    -- String functions with aggregation
    UPPER(Department) AS DepartmentName,       -- Transform d.DepartmentName names
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    
    -- Date functions with aggregation
    AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS AvgYearsService,
    MIN(YEAR(HireDate)) AS FirstHireYear,
    MAX(YEAR(HireDate)) AS LastHireYear,
    
    -- Math functions with aggregation
    ROUND(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 0) AS RoundedAvgSalary,
    CEILING(AVG(e.BaseSalary)) AS CeilingAvgSalary,
    
    -- Format functions for display
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS FormattedTotalSalary,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'N2') AS FormattedAvgSalary
    
FROM Employees
WHERE HireDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY UPPER(Department)
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### Exercise 8.1: Advanced Date Analysis (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

**Business Question**: "Analyze employee tenure patterns and seasonal hiring trends."

```sql
-- Complex date functions with aggregation
SELECT 
    -- Tenure grouping using date functions
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 1 THEN 'New (< 1 year)'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 3 THEN 'Junior (1-3 years)'
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 7 THEN 'Experienced (3-7 years)'
        ELSE 'Veteran (7+ years)'
    END AS TenureGroup,
    
    -- Seasonal hiring analysis
    DATENAME(QUARTER, HireDate) AS HireQuarter,
    
    -- Aggregation with date calculations
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AvgSalary,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(MONTH, HireDate, GETDATE())) AS AvgMonthsEmployed,
    
    -- Calculate retention insights
    MIN(HireDate) AS EarliestHireInGroup,
    MAX(HireDate) AS LatestHireInGroup,
    
    -- Format complex calculations
    FORMAT(
        AVG(e.BaseSalary) / NULLIF(AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE())), 0),

        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 7 THEN 'Experienced (3-7 years)'
        ELSE 'Veteran (7+ years)'
    END,
    DATENAME(QUARTER, HireDate)
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 1 THEN 1
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 3 THEN 2
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) < 7 THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END,
    DATENAME(QUARTER, HireDate);
```

### Exercise 8.2: String Analysis with Aggregation (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

    STRING_AGG(
        CONCAT(LEFT(FirstName, 1), '. ', LastName), 
        ', '
    ) AS EmployeeInitials,
    
    -- Complex string analysis
