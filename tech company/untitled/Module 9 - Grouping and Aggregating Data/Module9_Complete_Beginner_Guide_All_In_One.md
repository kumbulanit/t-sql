---

# PART A: LESSON 1 - Basic Counting and Adding with SQL

## 📖 What Will You Learn in Part A?

You'll learn to ask your database simple questions like:

- **"How many employees do we have?"** (Counting)
- **"What's the total of all salaries?"** (Adding)  
- **"What's the average BaseSalary?"** (Average)
- **"Who earns the most/least?"** (Highest/Lowest)

These are called **aggregate functions** - fancy words for "math functions that work on groups of data."

## 🎓 What You'll Be Able to Do After Part A

✅ Count things in your database  
✅ Add up numbers  
✅ Find averages  
✅ Find the biggest and smallest numbers  
✅ Answer basic business questions with data  

## Section 1: Counting Things 📊

### 🎓 Let's Start Simple: Counting

Imagine you have a box of marbles and want to know how many you have. Instead of counting by hand, SQL can count for you!

**The COUNT Function**: `COUNT(*)` = "Count everything"

### Exercise 1.1: Count All Employees (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "How many people work at TechCorp?"

```sql
-- Step 1: Tell SQL which database to use
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Step 2: Count all employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees e;
```

**What this does:**
- `COUNT(*)` counts every row in the Employees table
- `AS NumberOfEmployees` gives the result a friendly name

**Expected Result:** `15` (if there are 15 employees)

### Exercise 1.2: Count Specific Things (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "How many projects do we have?"

```sql
-- Count all projects
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalProjects
FROM Projects p;
```

**Your Turn**: Try counting clients too!
```sql
-- Count all clients
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalClients  
FROM Clients;
```

### 🎓 Advanced Counting: Only Count Non-Empty Values

Sometimes you want to count only rows that have actual data (not empty/NULL).

```sql
-- Count employees who have a phone number
SELECT COUNT(PhoneNumber) AS EmployeesWithPhone
FROM Employees e;

-- Count vs Count(*) - See the difference
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS AllEmployees,
    COUNT(PhoneNumber) AS EmployeesWithPhone
FROM Employees e;
```

## Section 2: Adding Numbers (SUM) 📊

### 🎓 Adding Up Money

Now let's add up numbers, like calculating total salaries.

### Exercise 2.1: Total Company BaseSalary Cost (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "How much do we spend on salaries in total?"

```sql
-- Add up all salaries
SELECT SUM(e.BaseSalary) AS TotalBaseSalaryCost
FROM Employees e;
```

**Expected Result:** `$750,000` (if all salaries add up to $750,000)

### Exercise 2.2: Total Project Budgets (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Add up all project budgets
SELECT SUM(Budget) AS TotalProjectBudgets
FROM Projects p;
```

**Real-World Use**: This tells management how much money is committed to projects.

### Exercise 2.3: Your Turn - Total Revenue (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Add up all client contract values
SELECT SUM(ContractValue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Clients;
```

## Section 3: Finding Averages (AVG) 📊

### Exercise 3.1: Average e.BaseSalary (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "What's the average e.BaseSalary at TechCorp?"

```sql
-- Calculate average e.BaseSalary
SELECT AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AverageBaseSalary
FROM Employees e;
```

### Exercise 3.2: Format Money Properly (🟢 BASIC)

Make numbers look like real money:

```sql
-- Format as currency
SELECT 
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS TotalBaseSalaries
FROM Employees e;
```

**Result**: Shows `$65,000` instead of `65000.00`

## Section 4: Finding Highest and Lowest (MIN/MAX) 📊

### Exercise 4.1: BaseSalary Range (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "What are the highest and lowest salaries?"

```sql
-- Find e.BaseSalary range  
SELECT 
    MIN(e.BaseSalary) AS LowestBaseSalary,
    MAX(e.BaseSalary) AS HighestBaseSalary
FROM Employees e;
```

### Exercise 4.2: Project Date Range (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

```sql
-- Find earliest and latest project dates
SELECT 
    MIN(StartDate) AS EarliestProject,
    MAX(EndDate) AS LatestProject  
FROM Projects p;
```

## Section 5: Combining Multiple Functions (🟢 BASIC)

### Exercise 5.1: Complete Employee Summary (🟢 BASIC)

```sql
-- Get complete e.BaseSalary statistics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
    FORMAT(MIN(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS LowestBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(MAX(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS HighestBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS TotalBaseSalaryCost
FROM Employees e;
```

**Business Value**: This gives management a complete picture of BaseSalary costs and ranges.

# PART B: LESSON 2 - Organizing Data into Groups

## 📖 What is GROUP BY?

GROUP BY is like organizing things into separate piles:

- **Sort employees** by d.DepartmentName (IT pile, Sales pile, etc.)
- **Count** how many are in each pile
- **Add up salaries** for each d.DepartmentName separately  
- **Compare** different departments side by side

Think of it as making separate mini-reports for each group.

## 🎓 What You'll Learn in Part B

✅ Understand what grouping means  
✅ Group data by categories (like departments)  
✅ Count things in each group  
✅ Add up numbers for each group  
✅ Compare groups side by side  

## Section 1: Understanding Groups 📊

### 🎓 Real Life Example: Sorting Apples

Imagine you work at a fruit store and have 100 apples of different colors:
- **Without grouping**: "We have 100 apples total"
- **With grouping**: "We have 40 red apples, 35 green apples, and 25 yellow apples"

GROUP BY does the same thing with database data!

### Exercise 1.1: Count Employees by d.DepartmentName (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "How many people work in each department?"

```sql
-- Connect to database
USE TechCorpDB;

-- Count employees in each d.DepartmentName
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
```

### Exercise 2.3: Project Budgets by Client (🟢 BASIC)

```sql
-- Total project budget for each client
SELECT 
    c.ClientName,
    COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS NumberOfProjects,
    FORMAT(SUM(p.Budget), 'C0') AS TotalBudget
FROM Clients c
INNER JOIN Projects p ON c.ClientID = p.ClientID
GROUP BY c.ClientName;
```

## Section 3: Sorting Your Results 📊

### Exercise 3.1: Departments by Employee Count (🟢 BASIC)

```sql
-- Show departments sorted by size (largest first)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName  
ORDER BY SUM(e.BaseSalary) DESC;
```

## Section 4: Multiple Grouping Columns (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

### Exercise 4.1: Count by d.DepartmentName and Position (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

```sql
-- Count employees by d.DepartmentName AND position
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    Position,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName, Position
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, Position;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
d.DepartmentName  | Position    | EmployeeCount
IT          | Developer   | 3
IT          | Manager     | 1
IT          | Tester      | 1
Sales       | Manager     | 1
Sales       | Rep         | 3
```

# PART C: LESSON 3 - Filtering Your Groups

## 📖 What is HAVING?

HAVING is like a filter for your groups:

- **First**: GROUP BY organizes your data into groups
- **Then**: HAVING removes groups that don't meet your criteria
- **Result**: You only see the groups that matter to you

Think of it as "Show me only the groups where..."

## 🎓 What You'll Learn in Part C

✅ Understand the difference between WHERE and HAVING  
✅ Filter groups based on counts (show only big departments)  
✅ Filter groups based on totals (show only high-budget projects)  
✅ Use multiple filters together  
✅ Answer focused business questions  

## Section 1: WHERE vs HAVING - What's the Difference? 📊

### 🎓 Understanding the Difference

This is the most important concept to understand:

**WHERE** = Filters individual rows BEFORE grouping
- "Show me employees who earn more than $50,000"
- Removes employees first, then groups the remaining ones

**HAVING** = Filters groups AFTER grouping and calculating
- "Show me departments that have more than 3 employees"  
- Groups all employees first, then removes small departments

**Memory Trick**: WHERE comes before GROUP BY, HAVING comes after GROUP BY

### Exercise 1.1: See the Difference (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Query without filtering:**
```sql
-- All departments with their employee counts
USE TechCorpDB;

SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
d.DepartmentName  | EmployeeCount  
IT          | 5
Sales       | 4
Marketing   | 3
```

**What happened?** HR (2 employees) and Finance (1 employee) were filtered out!

## Section 2: Filtering by Counts 📊

### Exercise 2.1: Large Departments Only (🟢 SUPER BASIC)

**Question**: "Which departments have more than 3 employees?"

```sql
-- Show only departments with more than 3 employees
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING SUM(e.BaseSalary) > 200000
ORDER BY SUM(e.BaseSalary) DESC;
```

### Exercise 3.2: High-Value Clients (🟢 BASIC)

```sql
-- Show clients with total project budget over $50,000
SELECT 
    c.ClientName,
    COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS NumberOfProjects,
    FORMAT(SUM(p.Budget), 'C0') AS TotalBudget
FROM Clients c
INNER JOIN Projects p ON c.ClientID = p.ClientID
GROUP BY c.ClientName
HAVING SUM(p.Budget) > 50000
ORDER BY SUM(p.Budget) DESC;
```

## Section 4: Complex Filtering (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

### Exercise 4.1: Multiple Conditions with HAVING (🟢 INTERMEDIATE)

**Question**: "Which departments have more than 2 employees AND total e.BaseSalary cost over $150,000?"

```sql
-- Multiple HAVING conditions
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2               -- Filter groups second
ORDER BY AVG(e.BaseSalary) DESC;
```

# PART D: HANDS-ON PRACTICE EXERCISES

## Lab Exercise 1: d.DepartmentName Analysis Dashboard (🟢 BASIC)

**Business Question**: "Create a d.DepartmentName overview report for management."

```sql
-- Complete d.DepartmentName analysis
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.BaseSalary > 50000                    -- Filter: only high earners
  AND e.HireDate >= '2020-01-01'         -- Filter: recent hires only
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2                    -- Filter: departments with multiple high earners
ORDER BY AVG(e.BaseSalary) DESC;              -- Sort: highest paying departments first
```

### Exercise E4: Module 6 + Module 8 + Module 9 (Data Types + Functions + Grouping)

**Date Functions + Math Functions + Grouping**: Advanced business analysis

```sql
-- Employee tenure and e.BaseSalary analysis
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.HireDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
ORDER BY AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.HireDate, GETDATE())) DESC;
```

### Exercise E5: Complete Business Intelligence Report

**All Modules Combined**: Real-world business dashboard query

```sql
-- Executive Dashboard: Complete company overview
SELECT 
    'Company Overview' AS ReportSection,
    
    -- Employee metrics
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.d.DepartmentName) AS NumberOfDepartments,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    
    -- Project metrics  
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) AS TotalProjects,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.IsActive = 'Completed' THEN p.ProjectID END) AS CompletedProjects,
    FORMAT(SUM(p.Budget), 'C0') AS TotalProjectBudget,
    
    -- Client metrics
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.ClientID) AS TotalClients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.Industry) AS IndustriesServed,
    
    -- Time metrics
    MIN(e.HireDate) AS OldestEmployee,
    MAX(p.StartDate) AS NewestProject
    
FROM Employees e
CROSS JOIN Projects p  
CROSS JOIN Clients c;

-- d.DepartmentName performance comparison
SELECT e.d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount,
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS TotalBaseSalaryCost,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS AverageBaseSalary,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) AS ProjectsWorkedOn,
    FORMAT(SUM(p.Budget), 'C0') AS ProjectBudgetManaged,
    
    -- Calculate efficiency metric
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) > 0 
        THEN FORMAT(SUM(p.Budget) / COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID), 'C0')
        ELSE '$0'
    END AS BudgetPerEmployee
    
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Projects p ON e.DepartmentName = 'IT' AND p.Status IS NOT NULL  -- Simplified relationship
GROUP BY e.d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID) > 0
ORDER BY SUM(p.Budget) DESC;
```

# PART F: QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

## 📋 SQL Clause Order (CRITICAL!)

**Always use this order - SQL will give errors if you mix it up:**

```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM table(s)
WHERE condition_for_rows
GROUP BY column(s)
HAVING condition_for_groups  
ORDER BY column(s);
```

## 🔧 Common Aggregate Functions

| Function | What It Does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `COUNT(*)` | Counts all rows | `COUNT(*) = 15` |
| `COUNT(column)` | Counts non-null values | `COUNT(PhoneNumber) = 12` |
| `SUM(column)` | Adds up numbers | `SUM(e.BaseSalary) = 750000` |
| `AVG(column)` | Calculates average | `AVG(e.BaseSalary) = 50000` |
| `MIN(column)` | Finds smallest value | `MIN(e.BaseSalary) = 35000` |
| `MAX(column)` | Finds largest value | `MAX(e.BaseSalary) = 95000` |

## 🎯 Common Business Questions and SQL Patterns

| Business Question | SQL Pattern |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "How many X do we have?" | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;` |
| "What's our total revenue?" | `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM table;` |
| "How many X in each category?" | `SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY category;` |
| "Which categories have more than N items?" | `SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) > N;` |
| "What's the average per category?" | `SELECT category, AVG(amount) FROM table GROUP BY category;` |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Wrong clause order
```sql
-- WRONG:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;

-- RIGHT:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

### Mistake 2: Selecting non-grouped columns
```sql
-- WRONG:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, EmployeeName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;

-- RIGHT:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
```

### Mistake 3: Using WHERE for group conditions
```sql
-- WRONG:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
WHERE COUNT(*) > 2
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;

-- RIGHT:
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```
