# Lab: Writing Basic SELECT Statements - Beginner Lab

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Overview (ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETE BEGINNER LEVEL)

Welcome! This hands-on lab lets you practice writing SELECT statements step by step. You'll work through real TechCorp scenarios, starting with the simplest queries and building up your confidence. Perfect for complete beginners!

## ðŸ“– What You'll Practice

In this lab, you'll practice:

âœ… Writing your first SELECT statements  
âœ… Choosing specific columns to display  
âœ… Using professional column names (aliases)  
âœ… Limiting results with TOP  
âœ… Combining columns creatively  
âœ… Solving real business questions  

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Scenario

You're the new Data Assistant at TechCorp! Your manager needs various reports about employees, departments, and projects. You'll use SELECT statements to create these reports.

## Part 1: Your First SELECT Statements ðŸ“Š

### Exercise 1.1: See All Employee Data (ðŸŸ¢ SUPER BASIC)

**Task**: Your manager wants to see what employee data we have. Show all columns from the Employees table, but limit it to just 3 employees so it's not overwhelming.

```sql
-- Write your query here:

-- SOLUTION (try first, then check):
SELECT TOP 3 *
FROM Employees e;
```

**Expected Result**: You should see the first 3 employees with all their information columns.

### Exercise 1.2: Choose Specific Columns (ðŸŸ¢ BASIC)

**Task**: The manager only needs employee names and job titles for a meeting. Show FirstName, LastName, and JobTitle for the first 5 employees.

```sql
-- Write your query here:




-- SOLUTION:
SELECT TOP 5
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    e.JobTitle
FROM Employees e;
```

### Exercise 1.3: Make It Look Professional (ðŸŸ¢ BASIC)

**Task**: The previous report looked too technical. Make the column headers friendly by using aliases: "First Name", "Last Name", and "Job Position".

```sql
-- Write your query here:




-- SOLUTION:
SELECT TOP 5
    e.FirstName AS [First Name],
    e.LastName AS [Last Name], 
    e.JobTitle AS [Job Position]
FROM Employees e;
-- Your solution here:
-- [Space for student to write their answer]
```
