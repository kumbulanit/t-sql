        ELSE 'Junior Level'
    END AS SalaryBand
FROM Employees;
```

#### Module 4: Multi-Table Queries
```sql
-- Complex JOINs across TechCorp business entities
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    p.ProjectName,
    ep.Role
FROM Companies c
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON c.CompanyID = d.CompanyID
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
    LEFT JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
    LEFT JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID;
```

#### Module 5: Sorting and Filtering
```sql
-- Advanced filtering with business logic
SELECT TOP 10 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS TopPerformer,
    e.BaseSalary,
    pm.Achievement,
    jl.LevelName
FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN PerformanceMetrics pm ON e.EmployeeID = pm.EmployeeID
    INNER JOIN JobLevels jl ON e.JobLevelID = jl.JobLevelID
WHERE pm.Achievement > 95.0
    AND e.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY pm.Achievement DESC, e.BaseSalary DESC;
```

#### Module 6: Data Types
```sql
