**ðŸŽ¯ Business Explanation**: Data standardization is crucial for reporting accuracy and professional presentation. This transformation ensures all employee names follow consistent formatting, phone numbers are readable, and email addresses are properly categorized. Clean data improves customer-facing reports and internal communications.

- **String manipulation functions**: UPPER, LOWER, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING (Module 8, Lesson 2)
- **Whitespace handling**: LTRIM, RTRIM for cleaning (Module 8, Lesson 2)  
- **String searching**: CHARINDEX for finding characters (Module 8, Lesson 2)
- **Complex CASE logic**: Multi-condition string analysis
- **CONCAT vs + operator**: Safe string concatenation handling NULLs
- **LEN function**: String length analysis for validation

**ðŸŽ¯ Business Explanation**: This comprehensive departmental dashboard provides executives with key performance indicators for strategic decision-making. The health score combines multiple factors to quickly identify departments needing attention or investment.

**ðŸ”§ Technical Breakdown**:

- **Complex CTEs**: Multi-stage data preparation (advanced Module 9)
- **Multiple GROUP BY levels**: Department and project aggregations (Module 9, Lesson 2)
- **Conditional aggregation**: COUNT(CASE WHEN) pattern (Module 9, Lesson 1)
- **Statistical functions**: STDEV, percentiles, ratios (Module 9, Lesson 1)
- **Window functions**: ROW_NUMBER for latest performance data (Module 9)
- **HAVING clauses**: Filter aggregated results (Module 9, Lesson 3)
- **NULLIF function**: Prevent division by zero errors (Module 8)

**ðŸ’¡ Beginner Tips**:

- Use CTEs to break complex queries into logical steps
- NULLIF prevents division by zero in ratio calculations  
- Conditional aggregation is powerful for creating multiple metrics in one query
- Always consider what NULL values mean in your business context
