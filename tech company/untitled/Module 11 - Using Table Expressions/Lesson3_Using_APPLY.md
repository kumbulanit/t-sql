# Lesson 3: Using APPLY

## Overview

The APPLY operator is a unique T-SQL feature that allows you to invoke a table-valued function or a derived table for each row of an outer table expression. APPLY comes in two variants: CROSS APPLY (similar to INNER JOIN) and OUTER APPLY (similar to LEFT OUTER JOIN). This powerful operator enables complex per-row processing and is essential for advanced data analysis in TechCorp's business scenarios.

## 🏢 TechCorp Business Context

**APPLY Operations in Business:**
- **Per-Row Analysis**: Calculating metrics for each individual record
- **Top-N Analysis**: Finding top performers for each department/category
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Applying complex logic based on row context
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Working with parent-child relationships
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends for each entity over time

### 📋 TechCorp Schema Quick Reference

**Key Tables for APPLY Examples:**
```sql
Employees: EmployeeID (3001+), FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary, DepartmentID, ManagerID, JobTitle, HireDate, IsActive
Departments: DepartmentID (2001+), DepartmentName, Budget, Location, IsActive
Projects: ProjectID (4001+), ProjectName, Budget, ProjectManagerID, StartDate, EndDate, IsActive
Orders: OrderID (5001+), CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, IsActive
EmployeeProjects: EmployeeID, ProjectID, Role, StartDate, EndDate, HoursWorked, IsActive
Customers: CustomerID (6001+), CompanyName, ContactName, City, Country, IsActive
```

```

### When to Use APPLY

1. **Top-N per Group**: Getting the top N records for each category
2. **Complex Correlations**: When you need more than simple column correlation
3. **Dynamic Filtering**: When filter conditions depend on outer row values
4. **Table-Valued Functions**: Applying functions that return multiple rows
5. **Performance Optimization**: Sometimes more efficient than complex subqueries

## Basic APPLY Patterns

### 1. Top-N Analysis per Group

#### TechCorp Example: Top Earners by d.DepartmentName
```sql
-- Find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each d.DepartmentName
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    d.Budget,
    top_earners.FirstName,
    top_earners.LastName,
    top_earners.JobTitle,
    FORMAT(top_earners.BaseSalary, 'C') AS BaseSalary,
    top_earners.SalaryRank
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3
        e.FirstName,
        e.LastName,
        e.JobTitle,
        e.BaseSalary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS SalaryRank
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC
) top_earners
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName, top_earners.BaseSalary DESC;
```

#### TechCorp Example: Recent Orders per Customer
```sql
-- Get the 5 most recent orders for each customer
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.City,
    recent_orders.OrderDate,
    FORMAT(recent_orders.TotalAmount, 'C') AS OrderAmount,
    recent_orders.OrderRank,
    recent_orders.EmployeeName
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 5
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC) AS OrderRank,
        e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY c.CompanyName, recent_orders.OrderDate DESC;
```

### 2. Complex Per-Row Calculations

#### TechCorp Example: Employee Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Calculate comprehensive performance metrics for each employee
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    e.JobTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(e.BaseSalary, 'C') AS BaseSalary,
    perf_metrics.ProjectCount,
    perf_metrics.TotalProjectHours,
    perf_metrics.OrderCount,
    FORMAT(perf_metrics.TotalOrderValue, 'C') AS TotalOrderValue,
    perf_metrics.PerformanceScore
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        -- Project metrics
        ISNULL(project_stats.ProjectCount, 0) AS ProjectCount,
        ISNULL(project_stats.TotalHours, 0) AS TotalProjectHours,
        -- Order metrics
        ISNULL(order_stats.OrderCount, 0) AS OrderCount,
        ISNULL(order_stats.TotalValue, 0) AS TotalOrderValue,
        -- Combined performance score
        (ISNULL(project_stats.ProjectCount, 0) * 10 + 
         ISNULL(order_stats.OrderCount, 0) * 5 +
         CASE WHEN ISNULL(project_stats.TotalHours, 0) > 100 THEN 20 ELSE 0 END) AS PerformanceScore
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(DISTINCT ep.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount,
            SUM(ep.HoursWorked) AS TotalHours
        FROM EmployeeProjects ep
        WHERE ep.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
          AND ep.IsActive = 1
    ) project_stats
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount,
            SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalValue
        FROM Orders o
        WHERE o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
          AND o.IsActive = 1
    ) order_stats
) perf_metrics
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY perf_metrics.PerformanceScore DESC, e.LastName;
```

### 3. Dynamic Filtering with OUTER APPLY

#### TechCorp Example: d.DepartmentName Activity Overview
```sql
-- Show all departments with their recent activity (if any)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    d.Budget,
    d.Location,
    ISNULL(activity.RecentProjectCount, 0) AS RecentProjects,
    ISNULL(activity.RecentOrderCount, 0) AS RecentOrders,
    ISNULL(FORMAT(activity.RecentOrderValue, 'C'), '$0.00') AS RecentOrderValue,
    CASE 
        WHEN activity.RecentProjectCount > 0 OR activity.RecentOrderCount > 0 
        THEN 'Active' 
        ELSE 'Inactive' 
    END AS ActivityStatus
FROM Departments d
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT 
        -- Recent project activity (last 90 days)
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID)
         FROM Projects p
         INNER JOIN Employees e ON p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
         WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
           AND p.StartDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -90, GETDATE())
           AND p.IsActive = 1
           AND e.IsActive = 1) AS RecentProjectCount,
        -- Recent order activity (last 30 days)
        (SELECT COUNT(o.OrderID)
         FROM Orders o
         INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
         WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
           AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
           AND o.IsActive = 1
           AND e.IsActive = 1) AS RecentOrderCount,
        -- Recent order value
        (SELECT SUM(o.TotalAmount)
         FROM Orders o
         INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
         WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
           AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
           AND o.IsActive = 1
           AND e.IsActive = 1) AS RecentOrderValue
) activity
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY 
    CASE ActivityStatus WHEN 'Active' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END,
    d.DepartmentName;
```

## Advanced APPLY Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Data Processing

#### TechCorp Example: Management Hierarchy Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze management structure with subordinate details
SELECT 
    mgr.FirstName + ' ' + mgr.LastName AS ManagerName,
    mgr.JobTitle AS ManagerTitle,
    d.DepartmentName,
    FORMAT(mgr.BaseSalary, 'C') AS ManagerSalary,
    subordinate_info.SubordinateCount,
    FORMAT(subordinate_info.AvgSubordinateSalary, 'C') AS AvgSubordinateSalary,
    FORMAT(subordinate_info.TotalTeamSalary, 'C') AS TotalTeamSalary,
    subordinate_info.TopPerformer,
    FORMAT(subordinate_info.TopPerformerSalary, 'C') AS TopPerformerSalary
FROM Employees mgr
INNER JOIN Departments d ON mgr.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS SubordinateCount,
        AVG(sub.BaseSalary) AS AvgSubordinateSalary,
        SUM(sub.BaseSalary) + mgr.BaseSalary AS TotalTeamSalary,
        MAX(sub.FirstName + ' ' + sub.LastName) AS TopPerformer,
        MAX(sub.BaseSalary) AS TopPerformerSalary
    FROM Employees sub
    WHERE sub.ManagerID = mgr.EmployeeID
      AND sub.IsActive = 1
) subordinate_info
WHERE mgr.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM Employees sub 
      WHERE sub.ManagerID = mgr.EmployeeID 
        AND sub.IsActive = 1
  )
ORDER BY subordinate_info.SubordinateCount DESC, mgr.LastName;
```

### 2. Time-Series Analysis with APPLY

#### TechCorp Example: Customer Trend Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze customer purchasing trends over time
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    c.ContactName,
    c.Country,
    trend_analysis.FirstOrderDate,
    trend_analysis.LastOrderDate,
    trend_analysis.TotalOrders,
    FORMAT(trend_analysis.TotalSpent, 'C') AS TotalSpent,
    FORMAT(trend_analysis.AvgOrderValue, 'C') AS AvgOrderValue,
    trend_analysis.OrdersThisYear,
    trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear,
    CASE 
        WHEN trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear > 0 
        THEN CAST((trend_analysis.OrdersThisYear - trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear) * 100.0 / trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear AS DECIMAL(5,1))
        ELSE NULL 
    END AS YearOverYearGrowthPercent,
    CASE 
        WHEN trend_analysis.OrdersThisYear > trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear THEN 'Growing'
        WHEN trend_analysis.OrdersThisYear = trend_analysis.OrdersLastYear THEN 'Stable'
        ELSE 'Declining'
    END AS TrendDirection
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        MIN(o.OrderDate) AS FirstOrderDate,
        MAX(o.OrderDate) AS LastOrderDate,
        COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
        SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent,
        AVG(o.TotalAmount) AS AvgOrderValue,
        SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(o.OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS OrdersThisYear,
        SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(o.OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) - 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS OrdersLastYear
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.IsActive = 1
) trend_analysis
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND trend_analysis.TotalOrders > 0
ORDER BY trend_analysis.TotalSpent DESC;
```

### 3. Complex Business Logic with APPLY

#### TechCorp Example: Project Resource Allocation
```sql
-- Analyze project resource allocation and identify optimization opportunities
SELECT 
    p.ProjectName,
    p.Budget,
    mgr.FirstName + ' ' + mgr.LastName AS ProjectManager,
    p.StartDate,
    p.EndDate,
    resource_analysis.TeamSize,
    resource_analysis.TotalHours,
    FORMAT(resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost, 'C') AS TotalLaborCost,
    FORMAT(p.Budget - resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost, 'C') AS RemainingBudget,
    CAST((resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost * 100.0 / p.Budget) AS DECIMAL(5,1)) AS BudgetUtilizationPercent,
    resource_analysis.TopContributor,
    resource_analysis.TopContributorHours,
    CASE 
        WHEN resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost > p.Budget * 0.9 THEN 'Over Budget Risk'
        WHEN resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost > p.Budget * 0.75 THEN 'High Utilization'
        WHEN resource_analysis.TotalLaborCost < p.Budget * 0.25 THEN 'Under Utilized'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS BudgetStatus
FROM Projects p
INNER JOIN Employees mgr ON p.ProjectManagerID = mgr.EmployeeID
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT ep.EmployeeID) AS TeamSize,
        SUM(ep.HoursWorked) AS TotalHours,
        SUM(ep.HoursWorked * e.BaseSalary / 2080) AS TotalLaborCost,  -- Assuming 2080 working hours per year
        TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.EmployeeName AS TopContributor,
        TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.HoursWorked AS TopContributorHours
    FROM EmployeeProjects ep
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON ep.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    CROSS APPLY (
        SELECT TOP 1
            e2.FirstName + ' ' + e2.LastName AS EmployeeName,
            ep2.HoursWorked
        FROM EmployeeProjects ep2
        INNER JOIN Employees e2 ON ep2.EmployeeID = e2.EmployeeID
        WHERE ep2.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
          AND ep2.IsActive = 1
          AND e2.IsActive = 1
        ORDER BY ep2.HoursWorked DESC
    ) TOP_CONTRIBUTOR
    WHERE ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
      AND ep.IsActive = 1
      AND e.IsActive = 1
) resource_analysis
WHERE p.IsActive = 1
  AND mgr.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY 
    CASE BudgetStatus 
        WHEN 'Over Budget Risk' THEN 1 
        WHEN 'High Utilization' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'Under Utilized' THEN 3 
        ELSE 4 
    END,
    p.ProjectName;
```

## Performance Considerations with APPLY

### 1. Index Optimization

#### Indexing for APPLY Operations
```sql
-- Recommended indexes for optimal APPLY performance:
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_DepartmentID_Salary ON Employees(DepartmentID, BaseSalary DESC, IsActive);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_CustomerID_OrderDate ON Orders(CustomerID, OrderDate DESC, IsActive);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_EmployeeProjects_EmployeeID_Hours ON EmployeeProjects(EmployeeID, HoursWorked DESC, IsActive);

-- Optimized query using proper indexes
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    top_performers.FirstName,
    top_performers.LastName,
    top_performers.BaseSalary
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 2 FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID  -- Uses index efficiently
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC
) top_performers
WHERE d.IsActive = 1;
```

### 2. APPLY vs Alternative Approaches

#### Performance Comparison
```sql
-- ✅ APPLY approach (efficient for Top-N per group)
SELECT d.DepartmentName, top_emp.FirstName, top_emp.LastName, top_emp.BaseSalary
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC
) top_emp
WHERE d.IsActive = 1;

-- ⚠️ Window function alternative (may be less efficient for small Top-N)
SELECT d.DepartmentName, FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary
FROM (
    SELECT d.DepartmentName,
        e.FirstName,
        e.LastName,
        e.BaseSalary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY d.DepartmentID ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) as rn
    FROM Departments d
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
    WHERE d.IsActive = 1 AND e.IsActive = 1
) ranked
WHERE rn = 1;

-- ✅ Correlated subquery alternative (sometimes simpler)
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    (SELECT TOP 1 e.FirstName FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1 ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS FirstName,
    (SELECT TOP 1 e.LastName FROM Employees e WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1 ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS LastName,
    (SELECT TOP 1 e.BaseSalary FROM Employees e WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1 ORDER BY e.BaseSalary DESC) AS BaseSalary
FROM Departments d
WHERE d.IsActive = 1;
```

## Best Practices for APPLY Operations

### 1. Proper Query Structure

#### Clear and Maintainable APPLY Queries
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Well-structured APPLY with clear purpose and aliases
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    d.DepartmentName,
    recent_activity.ProjectCount,
    recent_activity.RecentProjectName,
    recent_activity.LastProjectDate
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
OUTER APPLY (
    -- Get recent project activity for each employee
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount,
        TOP_PROJECT.ProjectName AS RecentProjectName,
        TOP_PROJECT.StartDate AS LastProjectDate
    FROM EmployeeProjects ep
    INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
    CROSS APPLY (
        -- Get the most recent project
        SELECT TOP 1 proj.ProjectName, proj.StartDate
        FROM Projects proj
        INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep2 ON proj.ProjectID = ep2.ProjectID
        WHERE ep2.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
          AND proj.IsActive = 1
          AND ep2.IsActive = 1
        ORDER BY proj.StartDate DESC
    ) TOP_PROJECT
    WHERE ep.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
      AND p.IsActive = 1
      AND ep.IsActive = 1
) recent_activity
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY e.LastName, e.FirstName;
```

### 2. Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### Handling NULL and Empty Results
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Proper NULL handling with OUTER APPLY
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
    ISNULL(emp_stats.EmployeeCount, 0) AS EmployeeCount,
    ISNULL(FORMAT(emp_stats.AvgSalary, 'C'), 'N/A') AS AvgSalary,
    ISNULL(emp_stats.TopEmployee, 'None') AS TopEmployee
FROM Departments d
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
        AVG(e.BaseSalary) AS AvgSalary,
        MAX(e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName) AS TopEmployee
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      AND e.IsActive = 1
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0  -- Only return results if employees exist
) emp_stats
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY d.DepartmentName;
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Efficient Filtering and Limiting
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Early filtering and appropriate TOP usage
SELECT 
    c.CompanyName,
    recent_orders.OrderDate,
    recent_orders.TotalAmount
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 5 
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())  -- Filter early
      AND o.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1
  AND c.Country = 'USA'  -- Filter customers early
ORDER BY c.CompanyName;
```

## Common Use Cases and Business Applications

### 1. Business Intelligence Dashboards

#### TechCorp Example: Executive Summary with APPLY
```sql
-- Create comprehensive executive dashboard using APPLY
SELECT 
    'Department Performance' AS ReportSection,
    d.DepartmentName AS Category,
    dept_metrics.EmployeeCount,
    FORMAT(dept_metrics.TotalSalaryBudget, 'C') AS Budget,
    dept_metrics.ProjectCount,
    dept_metrics.RecentOrderCount,
    dept_metrics.PerformanceRating
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        emp_metrics.EmployeeCount,
        emp_metrics.TotalSalaryBudget,
        proj_metrics.ProjectCount,
        order_metrics.RecentOrderCount,
        CASE 
            WHEN proj_metrics.ProjectCount >= 3 AND order_metrics.RecentOrderCount >= 10 THEN 'Excellent'
            WHEN proj_metrics.ProjectCount >= 2 OR order_metrics.RecentOrderCount >= 5 THEN 'Good'
            WHEN proj_metrics.ProjectCount >= 1 OR order_metrics.RecentOrderCount >= 1 THEN 'Fair'
            ELSE 'Needs Attention'
        END AS PerformanceRating
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
            SUM(e.BaseSalary) AS TotalSalaryBudget
        FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
    ) emp_metrics
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount
        FROM Projects p
        INNER JOIN Employees e ON p.ProjectManagerID = e.EmployeeID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID 
          AND p.IsActive = 1 
          AND e.IsActive = 1
    ) proj_metrics
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT(o.OrderID) AS RecentOrderCount
        FROM Orders o
        INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
          AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
          AND o.IsActive = 1 
          AND e.IsActive = 1
    ) order_metrics
) dept_metrics
WHERE d.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY 
    CASE dept_metrics.PerformanceRating 
        WHEN 'Excellent' THEN 1 
        WHEN 'Good' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'Fair' THEN 3 
        ELSE 4 
    END,
    d.DepartmentName;
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Performance Issues with Large Datasets

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Inefficient APPLY without proper filtering
SELECT c.CompanyName, all_orders.*
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT * FROM Orders o WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID  -- No filtering, returns all orders
) all_orders;

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Proper filtering and limiting
SELECT c.CompanyName, recent_orders.*
FROM Customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 10 OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
    FROM Orders o 
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
      AND o.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())  -- Filter by date
      AND o.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
) recent_orders
WHERE c.IsActive = 1;
```

### 2. Incorrect Use of CROSS APPLY vs OUTER APPLY

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Using CROSS APPLY when you want all departments
SELECT d.DepartmentName, emp.FirstName
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 FirstName FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
) emp;  -- This excludes departments with no employees

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Use OUTER APPLY to include all departments
SELECT d.DepartmentName, ISNULL(emp.FirstName, 'No Employees') AS TopEmployee
FROM Departments d
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 FirstName FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
) emp
WHERE d.IsActive = 1;
```

### 3. Complex Nested APPLY Operations

#### Problem and Solution
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: Overly complex nested APPLY (hard to maintain)
SELECT d.DepartmentName, complex_data.*
FROM Departments d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT data1.* FROM (
        SELECT data2.* FROM (
            SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Employees e1
            CROSS APPLY (SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Orders o1 WHERE o1.EmployeeID = e1.EmployeeID) nested1
            WHERE e1.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        ) data2
    ) data1
) complex_data;

-- ✅ SOLUTION: Break into simpler, more readable steps
WITH DepartmentTopEmployee AS (
    SELECT 
        d.DepartmentID,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.EmployeeID,
        e.FirstName,
        e.LastName
    FROM Departments d
    CROSS APPLY (
        SELECT TOP 1 EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
        FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
        WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
        ORDER BY BaseSalary DESC
    ) e
    WHERE d.IsActive = 1
)
SELECT dte.d.DepartmentName,
    dte.FirstName,
    dte.LastName,
    recent_order.OrderDate,
    recent_order.TotalAmount
FROM DepartmentTopEmployee dte
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 OrderDate, TotalAmount
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.EmployeeID = dte.EmployeeID AND o.IsActive = 1
    ORDER BY OrderDate DESC
) recent_order;
```

## Summary

APPLY operations are essential for:

**Key Benefits:**
- **Per-Row Processing** - Apply complex logic for each outer row
- **Top-N Analysis** - Get top performers for each group efficiently
- **Dynamic Calculations** - Perform context-sensitive calculations
- **Flexible Correlations** - More powerful than simple JOIN operations

**Common Use Cases:**
- Top-N queries per department/category
- Complex performance metrics calculation
- Hierarchical data analysis
- Time-series and trend analysis
- Business intelligence dashboards

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use appropriate indexing on correlated columns
- Filter data early in APPLY expressions
- Choose CROSS APPLY vs OUTER APPLY based on requirements
- Consider alternatives like window functions for some scenarios

**Best Practices:**
- Use meaningful aliases for APPLY expressions
- Handle NULL values appropriately with OUTER APPLY
- Limit results with TOP clause when appropriate
- Break complex nested APPLY into simpler CTEs
- Test performance with realistic data volumes

APPLY operations provide TechCorp with powerful capabilities for advanced data analysis, enabling sophisticated per-row processing and complex business intelligence queries that would be difficult or impossible with standard JOIN operations.
