## Exercise 1: Inner Join Mastery (30 points)

### 1.1 Basic Inner Join Applications Solutions

**Answer 1.1.1**: Employee Project Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Employee project performance with efficiency calculations
SELECT 
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS [Employee Name],
    e.JobTitle AS [Position],
    d.DepartmentName AS [Department],
    p.ProjectName AS [Project],
    p.Status AS [Project Status],
    p.Priority AS [Priority],
    ep.Role AS [Project Role],
    ep.HoursWorked AS [Hours Worked],
    ep.HoursAllocated AS [Hours Allocated],
    
    -- Efficiency calculation with NULL handling
    CASE 
        WHEN ep.HoursAllocated > 0 
        THEN CAST(ep.HoursWorked * 100.0 / ep.HoursAllocated AS DECIMAL(5,1))
        ELSE 0 
    END AS [Efficiency %],
    
    FORMAT(ep.HourlyRate, 'C') AS [Hourly Rate],
    FORMAT(ep.HoursWorked * ep.HourlyRate, 'C') AS [Total Earnings],
    
    -- Performance indicator
    CASE 
        WHEN ep.HoursWorked > ep.HoursAllocated * 1.1 THEN 'Over-performing'
        WHEN ep.HoursWorked >= ep.HoursAllocated * 0.9 THEN 'On Track'
        WHEN ep.HoursWorked >= ep.HoursAllocated * 0.7 THEN 'Behind Schedule'
        ELSE 'Needs Attention'
    END AS [Performance IsActive]
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
INNER JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND p.Status = 'In Progress'
  AND ep.HoursAllocated > 0
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN ep.HoursAllocated > 0 
        THEN ep.HoursWorked * 100.0 / ep.HoursAllocated
        ELSE 0 
    END DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Uses multiple INNER JOINs to combine employee, d.DepartmentName, project, and assignment data. Calculates efficiency with proper NULL handling and categorizes performance levels.

**Answer 1.1.2**: d.DepartmentName Resource Utilization
```sql
-- Comprehensive d.DepartmentName resource analysis
WITH DepartmentMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        d.DepartmentID,
        d.DepartmentName,
        d.Budget,
        d.Location,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.EmployeeID) AS ActiveEmployees,
        SUM(e.BaseSalary) AS TotalBaseSalaryCost,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ep.ProjectID) AS ActiveProjects,
        SUM(ep.HoursAllocated) AS TotalProjectHours,
        AVG(ep.HoursWorked / NULLIF(ep.HoursAllocated, 0)) AS AvgUtilizationRate,
        COUNT(DISTINCT es.SkillID) AS UniqueSkills
    FROM Departments d
    INNER JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
    LEFT JOIN EmployeeProjects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
    LEFT JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID AND p.Status = 'In Progress'
    LEFT JOIN EmployeeSkills es ON e.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    GROUP BY d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName, d.Budget, d.Location
)
SELECT d.DepartmentName AS [Department],
    FORMAT(Budget, 'C0') AS [Annual Budget],
    Location AS [Location],
    ActiveEmployees AS [Active Employees],
    FORMAT(TotalSalaryCost, 'C0') AS [BaseSalary Expense],
    CAST(TotalSalaryCost * 100.0 / Budget AS DECIMAL(5,1)) AS [Budget Used %],
    ActiveProjects AS [Active Projects],
    ISNULL(TotalProjectHours, 0) AS [Total Project Hours],
    CAST(ISNULL(AvgUtilizationRate * 100, 0) AS DECIMAL(5,1)) AS [Avg Utilization %],
    UniqueSkills AS [Skills Diversity],
    
    -- d.DepartmentName health assessment
    CASE 
        WHEN TotalSalaryCost > Budget THEN 'Over Budget - Review Required'
        WHEN ActiveProjects = 0 THEN 'No Active Projects'
        WHEN AvgUtilizationRate < 0.7 THEN 'Underutilized Resources'
        WHEN UniqueSkills < ActiveEmployees THEN 'Limited Skills Diversity'
        ELSE 'Healthy Operations'
    END AS [Department IsActive]
FROM DepartmentMetrics
WHERE ActiveEmployees > 0
ORDER BY [Budget Used %] DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Complex analysis using CTE to aggregate d.DepartmentName metrics, including budget utilization, project involvement, and skills diversity with health indicators.

    -- Average BaseSalary of employees with this skill
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C0') AS [Average BaseSalary],
    
    -- Skills gap assessment
    CASE 
        WHEN s.MarketDemand = 'Very High' AND COUNT(es.EmployeeID) <= 3 
             THEN 'Critical Gap - High Priority'

             THEN 'Certification Opportunity'
        ELSE 'Adequate Coverage'
    END AS [Skills Gap Assessment],
    
    -- Investment recommendation
    CASE 
        WHEN s.MarketDemand = 'Very High' AND AVG(e.BaseSalary) > 90000 
             THEN 'High Value - Retain and Expand'
        WHEN COUNT(es.EmployeeID) <= 2 AND s.MarketDemand IN ('High', 'Very High') 
             THEN 'Urgent Hiring/Training Need'
        WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN es.CertificationDate IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) = 0 
             THEN 'Certification Training Priority'

        WHEN 'High' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3 
        ELSE 4 
    END,
    COUNT(es.EmployeeID) ASC;
```

**Explanation**: Comprehensive skills analysis combining market demand with internal capabilities, certification rates, and BaseSalary data to identify skills gaps and investment priorities.
