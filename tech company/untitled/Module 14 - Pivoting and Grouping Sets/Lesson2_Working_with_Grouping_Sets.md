# Lesson 2: Working with Grouping Sets

## Overview

Grouping Sets is a powerful T-SQL feature that extends the capabilities of GROUP BY clauses, enabling multiple levels of aggregation in a single query. This advanced functionality includes ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS operations that provide comprehensive subtotals, cross-tabulations, and hierarchical summaries. For TechCorp's business intelligence and reporting needs, Grouping Sets delivers sophisticated analytical capabilities essential for executive dashboards, financial reporting, and multi-dimensional business analysis.

## 🏢 TechCorp Business Context

**Grouping Sets in Enterprise Analytics:**
- **Financial Reporting**: Multi-level budget analysis with subtotals and grand totals
- **Executive Dashboards**: Hierarchical performance metrics across organizational dimensions
- **Sales Analytics**: Revenue analysis by region, product, time period with all combinations
- **HR Analytics**: Employee cost analysis by d.DepartmentName, level, location with summaries
- **Operational Intelligence**: Resource utilization with multiple aggregation perspectives

### 📋 TechCorp Database Schema Reference

**Core Tables for Grouping Sets Operations:**
```sql
Employees: EmployeeID (3001+), FirstName, LastName, BaseSalary, DepartmentID, ManagerID, JobTitle, HireDate, WorkEmail, IsActive
Departments: DepartmentID (2001+), DepartmentName, Budget, Location, IsActive
Projects: ProjectID (4001+), ProjectName, Budget, ProjectManagerID, StartDate, EndDate, IsActive
Orders: OrderID (5001+), CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, IsActive
EmployeeProjects: EmployeeID, ProjectID, Role, StartDate, EndDate, HoursWorked, IsActive
Customers: CustomerID (6001+), CompanyName, ContactName, City, Country, WorkEmail, IsActive
```

### ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS Syntax

```sql
-- ROLLUP: Hierarchical subtotals (right-to-left hierarchy)
SELECT columns, AGG_FUNCTION(value)
FROM table
GROUP BY ROLLUP(column1, column2, column3);

-- CUBE: All possible combinations of groupings
SELECT columns, AGG_FUNCTION(value)
FROM table
GROUP BY CUBE(column1, column2, column3);

-- GROUPING SETS: Custom grouping combinations
SELECT columns, AGG_FUNCTION(value)
FROM table
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (column1, column2),
    (column1),
    (column2),
    ()  -- Grand total
);
```

## Basic ROLLUP Operations

### 1. Hierarchical Financial Reporting

#### TechCorp Example: d.DepartmentName Budget Analysis with Subtotals
```sql
-- Create comprehensive budget analysis with hierarchical subtotals
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(d.Location) = 1 AND GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) = 1 
        THEN 'COMPANY TOTAL'
        WHEN GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) = 1 
        THEN d.Location + ' LOCATION TOTAL'
        ELSE d.DepartmentName
    END AS Department_Level,
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(d.Location) = 1 THEN 'ALL LOCATIONS'
        ELSE d.Location
    END AS Location,
    COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS Employee_Count,
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Total_Salaries,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Average_Salary,
    FORMAT(SUM(d.Budget), 'C') AS Department_Budget,
    -- Calculate budget utilization
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(d.Budget) > 0 
        THEN CAST((SUM(e.BaseSalary) * 100.0 / SUM(d.Budget)) AS DECIMAL(5,2))
        ELSE 0
    END AS Budget_Utilization_Percent,
    -- Add grouping level indicators
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(d.Location) = 1 AND GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) = 1 
        THEN 'Level 0: Company Summary'
        WHEN GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) = 1 
        THEN 'Level 1: Location Summary'
        ELSE 'Level 2: d.DepartmentName Detail'
    END AS Aggregation_Level,
    -- Performance indicators
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) = 0 THEN  -- d.DepartmentName level only
            CASE 
                WHEN SUM(e.BaseSalary) * 100.0 / NULLIF(SUM(d.Budget), 0) > 90 
                THEN '⚠️ Over Budget Risk'
                WHEN SUM(e.BaseSalary) * 100.0 / NULLIF(SUM(d.Budget), 0) > 75 
                THEN '✅ Well Utilized'
                WHEN SUM(e.BaseSalary) * 100.0 / NULLIF(SUM(d.Budget), 0) > 50 
                THEN '📊 Moderate Usage'
                ELSE '💡 Under Utilized'
            END
        ELSE ''
    END AS Budget_Status
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
  AND d.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY ROLLUP(d.Location, d.DepartmentName)
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(d.Location),
    GROUPING(d.DepartmentName),
    d.Location,
    d.DepartmentName;
```

### 2. Time-Based Revenue Analysis

#### TechCorp Example: Quarterly Sales Performance with ROLLUP
```sql
-- Comprehensive quarterly sales analysis with time-based hierarchy
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(SalesYear) = 1 AND GROUPING(SalesQuarter) = 1

        ELSE 'Q' + CAST(SalesQuarter AS VARCHAR)
    END AS Quarter_Display,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.CustomerID) AS Unique_Customers,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS Total_Orders,
    FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS Total_Revenue,
    FORMAT(AVG(o.TotalAmount), 'C') AS Average_Order_Value,
    FORMAT(SUM(o.TotalAmount) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT o.CustomerID), 0), 'C') AS Revenue_Per_Customer,
    -- Growth calculations (where applicable)
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(SalesQuarter) = 0 THEN  -- Quarter level only
            FORMAT(
                SUM(o.TotalAmount) - LAG(SUM(o.TotalAmount)) OVER (
                    ORDER BY SalesYear, SalesQuarter
                ), 'C'
            )
        ELSE NULL
    END AS QoQ_Growth_Amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(SalesQuarter) = 0 THEN  -- Quarter level only
            CAST(
                (SUM(o.TotalAmount) - LAG(SUM(o.TotalAmount)) OVER (
                    ORDER BY SalesYear, SalesQuarter
                )) * 100.0 / NULLIF(LAG(SUM(o.TotalAmount)) OVER (
                    ORDER BY SalesYear, SalesQuarter
                ), 0) AS DECIMAL(5,2)
            )
        ELSE NULL
    END AS QoQ_Growth_Percent,
    -- Performance classification
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(SalesYear) = 1 AND GROUPING(SalesQuarter) = 1 
        THEN '🏆 Company Performance'
        WHEN GROUPING(SalesQuarter) = 1 
        THEN '📅 Annual Performance'
        ELSE '📊 Quarterly Performance'
    END AS Performance_Category
FROM (
    SELECT 
        o.OrderID,
        o.CustomerID,
        o.TotalAmount,
        YEAR(o.OrderDate) AS SalesYear,
        DATEPART(QUARTER, o.OrderDate) AS SalesQuarter
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.IsActive = 1
      AND o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'  -- Focus on recent performance
      AND o.OrderDate < '2026-01-01'
) o
GROUP BY ROLLUP(SalesYear, SalesQuarter)
HAVING SUM(o.TotalAmount) > 0  -- Exclude periods with no sales
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(SalesYear),
    GROUPING(SalesQuarter),
    SalesYear,
    SalesQuarter;
```

## Advanced GROUPING Functions

### 1. GROUPING and GROUPING_ID Functions

#### TechCorp Example: Advanced Grouping Identification
```sql
-- Demonstrate advanced grouping identification and custom labels
SELECT 
    Location,
    DepartmentName,
    JobTitle,
    COUNT(*) AS Employee_Count,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Average_Salary,
    -- GROUPING function for individual columns (returns 0 or 1)
    GROUPING(Location) AS Location_Grouped,
    GROUPING(d.DepartmentName) AS Department_Grouped,
    GROUPING(JobTitle) AS JobTitle_Grouped,
    -- GROUPING_ID for combination identification (returns bitmask)
    GROUPING_ID(Location, DepartmentName, JobTitle) AS Grouping_Level_ID,
    -- Custom level identification using GROUPING_ID
    CASE GROUPING_ID(Location, DepartmentName, JobTitle)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'L4: Detailed (Location + d.DepartmentName + Job Title)'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'L3: Location + d.DepartmentName Summary'

        WHEN 5 THEN 'L2: d.DepartmentName Summary'
        WHEN 6 THEN 'L2: Job Title Summary'
        WHEN 7 THEN 'L1: Grand Total'
        ELSE 'Unknown Level'
    END AS Analysis_Level,
    -- Business intelligence based on grouping level
    CASE GROUPING_ID(Location, DepartmentName, JobTitle)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Operational Detail Analysis'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Department Management Analysis'

        WHEN 3 THEN 'Regional Performance Analysis'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Role Distribution Analysis'
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Department Strategy Analysis'
        WHEN 6 THEN 'Company-wide Role Analysis'
        WHEN 7 THEN 'Executive Summary'
    END AS Business_Purpose
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1 AND d.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY CUBE(Location, DepartmentName, JobTitle)
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING_ID(Location, DepartmentName, JobTitle),

## Performance Optimization for Grouping Sets

### 1. Indexing Strategy

```sql
-- Recommended indexes for optimal Grouping Sets performance
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_Dept_Location_Salary ON Employees(DepartmentID, IsActive) INCLUDE (BaseSalary, JobTitle, HireDate);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Departments_Location_Budget ON Departments(Location, IsActive) INCLUDE (DepartmentName, Budget);
-- CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_Employee_Date_Amount ON Orders(EmployeeID, OrderDate, IsActive) INCLUDE (TotalAmount, CustomerID);

-- Optimized Grouping Sets query with proper indexing
SELECT 
    d.Location,
    d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS Employee_Count,
    FORMAT(SUM(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Total_Compensation,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Average_Salary
FROM Employees e WITH(INDEX(IX_Employees_Dept_Location_Salary))
INNER JOIN Departments d WITH(INDEX(IX_Departments_Location_Budget)) 
    ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.IsActive = 1 
  AND d.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY ROLLUP(d.Location, d.DepartmentName)
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(d.Location),
    GROUPING(d.DepartmentName),
    d.Location,
    d.DepartmentName;
```

### 2. Query Optimization Best Practices

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Efficient Grouping Sets with proper filtering
WITH FilteredEmployeeData AS (
    -- Pre-filter data to reduce processing overhead
    SELECT 
        d.Location,
        d.DepartmentName,
        e.BaseSalary,
        e.JobTitle
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1
      AND d.IsActive = 1
      AND e.HireDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -5, GETDATE())  -- Recent hires only
      AND e.BaseSalary > 0  -- Valid BaseSalary data only
)
SELECT 
    ISNULL(Location, 'All Locations') AS Location,
    ISNULL(DepartmentName, 'All Departments') AS DepartmentName,
    COUNT(*) AS Employee_Count,
    FORMAT(AVG(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Average_Salary,
    FORMAT(MIN(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Min_Salary,
    FORMAT(MAX(e.BaseSalary), 'C') AS Max_Salary
FROM FilteredEmployeeData
GROUP BY ROLLUP(Location, d.DepartmentName)
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2  -- Only show groups with meaningful sample size
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(Location),
    GROUPING(d.DepartmentName),
    AVG(e.BaseSalary) DESC;
```
