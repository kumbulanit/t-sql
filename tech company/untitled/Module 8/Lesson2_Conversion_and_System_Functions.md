# Lesson 2: Conversion and System Functions - TechCorp Advanced Data Management

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Function Mastery (ðŸ”´ EXPERT LEVEL)

Building on Lesson 1's foundation, you'll now master the most sophisticated SQL Server functions. These are the tools that separate professional database developers from beginners - handling data type conversions, system metadata, and complex business logic.

## ðŸ“– TechCorp Business Evolution

As TechCorp Solutions has grown to 145 employees serving global clients, we need advanced data management capabilities:
- **Data Integration**: Converting data from various client systems
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time database health and performance metrics
- **Global Operations**: Multi-currency, timezone, and localization support
- **Automated Reporting**: System-generated reports with intelligent formatting

## Part 1: Conversion Functions - Data Type Mastery ðŸ”„

### ðŸŽ“ TUTORIAL: Why Conversion Functions Are Critical

Real-world databases receive data in many formats:
- **Client Systems**: Different date formats, number representations
- **Web Applications**: Everything comes as strings initially
- **Data Import**: Excel files, CSV imports, legacy system migrations
- **Reporting**: Need to format data for human consumption

**Business Impact**: Proper data conversion = accurate calculations = reliable business decisions

### Exercise 1.1: Basic Data Type Conversions (ðŸ”´ ADVANCED)

**Scenario**: TechCorp is integrating client data from multiple sources with different data formats.

```sql
-- Connect to TechCorp database
USE TechCorpDB;
GO

-- Lab 8.2.1: CAST and CONVERT Functions
-- Business scenario: Standardize data from various client import formats

-- Create a staging table for import data (simulating real-world data integration)
CREATE TABLE #ClientDataImport (
    ImportID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    CompanyName NVARCHAR(100),
    RevenueText NVARCHAR(50),        -- Revenue as text from Excel/CSV
    EmployeeCountText NVARCHAR(20),   -- Employee count as text
    FoundedDateText NVARCHAR(30),     -- Various date formats from different sources
    IsActiveText NVARCHAR(10),        -- Boolean values as text
    ContactPhoneText NVARCHAR(50),    -- Phone numbers in various formats
    ImportSource NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data showing real-world data integration challenges
INSERT INTO #ClientDataImport (CompanyName, RevenueText, EmployeeCountText, FoundedDateText, IsActiveText, ContactPhoneText, ImportSource)
VALUES
('ABC Corp', '$15,500,000.00', '125', '2010-01-15', 'true', '(555) 123-4567', 'Excel Import'),
('XYZ Ltd', '8750000', '95', '15/02/2015', 'Yes', '555.987.6543', 'CSV Import'),
('Global Inc', '125,000,000.00', '850', 'January 1, 2008', '1', '+1-555-0200', 'Legacy System'),

-- Conversion demonstrations with error handling

            WHEN RevenueText LIKE '%K' THEN REPLACE(REPLACE(RevenueText, '$', ''), 'K', '000')
            ELSE REPLACE(REPLACE(RevenueText, '$', ''), ',', '')
        END
    ) AS Revenue_CONVERT,

    TRY_CAST(EmployeeCountText AS INT) AS EmployeeCount,

    TRY_CONVERT(DATE, FoundedDateText, 103) AS FoundedDate_UK,  -- DD/MM/YYYY
    TRY_CONVERT(DATE, FoundedDateText, 120) AS FoundedDate_ISO, -- YYYY-MM-DD
    
    -- Best date conversion with multiple format attempts

System functions provide metadata and administrative information:
- **Database Health**: Monitor database size, performance, usage
- **Security Auditing**: Track user access, permissions, changes
- **Business Intelligence**: Understand data patterns, growth trends
- **Automated Operations**: Self-managing database systems
