## Exercise 1: SELECT Statement Fundamentals (20 points)

### 1.1 Basic Query Construction Solutions

**Answer 1.1.1**: Employee Information with Formatting
```sql
SELECT 
    -- Full name handling middle names properly
    e.FirstName + 
    CASE 
        WHEN e.MiddleName IS NOT NULL THEN ' ' + e.MiddleName + ' ' 
        ELSE ' ' 
    END + e.LastName AS [Employee Full Name],
    
    -- Formatted salary as currency
    FORMAT(e.Salary, 'C', 'en-US') AS [Annual Salary],
    
    -- Calculate age in years
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, e.BirthDate, GETDATE()) - 
    CASE 
        WHEN MONTH(e.BirthDate) > MONTH(GETDATE()) OR 
             (MONTH(e.BirthDate) = MONTH(GETDATE()) AND DAY(e.BirthDate) > DAY(GETDATE()))
        THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END AS [Current Age],
    
    -- Hire date formatted
    FORMAT(e.HireDate, 'MMMM dd, yyyy') AS [Hire Date],
    
    -- Phone number formatted
    CASE 
        WHEN e.Phone IS NOT NULL AND LEN(e.Phone) = 12 
        THEN '(' + SUBSTRING(e.Phone, 1, 3) + ') ' + 
             SUBSTRING(e.Phone, 5, 3) + '-' + 
             SUBSTRING(e.Phone, 9, 4)
        ELSE ISNULL(e.Phone, 'Not Available')
    END AS [Contact Phone]
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.IsActive = 1
ORDER BY e.LastName, e.FirstName;
```

**Explanation**: Uses string concatenation with NULL handling, FORMAT function for currency and dates, complex age calculation accounting for birthday timing, and conditional phone formatting.

**Answer 1.1.2**: Project Analysis Query
```sql
SELECT 
    p.ProjectName AS [Project Name],
    p.Status AS [Current Status],
    
    -- Budget utilization percentage
    CASE 
        WHEN p.Budget > 0 AND p.ActualCost IS NOT NULL 
        THEN CAST(ROUND(p.ActualCost / p.Budget * 100, 2) AS VARCHAR) + '%'
        WHEN p.ActualCost IS NULL THEN 'Not Available'
        ELSE '0%'
    END AS [Budget Utilization],
    
    -- Days elapsed since project start
    DATEDIFF(DAY, p.StartDate, GETDATE()) AS [Days Active],
    
    -- Timeline variance
    CASE 
        WHEN p.PlannedEndDate IS NOT NULL 
        THEN DATEDIFF(DAY, p.PlannedEndDate, ISNULL(p.EndDate, GETDATE()))
        ELSE NULL
    END AS [Timeline Variance Days],
    
    -- Client type classification
    CASE 
        WHEN p.ClientName = 'Internal' THEN 'Internal Project'
        WHEN p.ClientName IS NOT NULL THEN 'External Client'
        ELSE 'Unspecified'
    END AS [Client Classification],
    
    -- Project size category
    CASE 
        WHEN p.Budget < 75000 THEN 'Small Project'
        WHEN p.Budget BETWEEN 75000 AND 200000 THEN 'Medium Project'
        WHEN p.Budget > 200000 THEN 'Large Project'
        ELSE 'Unclassified'
    END AS [Project Scale]
FROM Projects p
ORDER BY p.Budget DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Demonstrates percentage calculations, date arithmetic, conditional logic for handling NULLs, and business categorization logic.

**Answer 1.1.3**: Department Overview
```sql
SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName AS [Department],
    d.Location AS [Office Location],
    
    -- Formatted budget
    FORMAT(d.Budget, 'C0', 'en-US') AS [Annual Budget],
    
    d.CostCenter AS [Cost Center Code],
    
    -- Manager information
    CASE 
        WHEN d.ManagerID IS NOT NULL 
        THEN m.FirstName + ' ' + m.LastName
        ELSE 'Position Vacant'
    END AS [Department Manager],
    
    -- Department size category
    CASE 
        WHEN d.Budget < 300000 THEN 'Small Department'
        WHEN d.Budget BETWEEN 300000 AND 600000 THEN 'Medium Department'
        WHEN d.Budget > 600000 THEN 'Large Department'
        ELSE 'Unclassified'
    END AS [Department Size Category],
    
    -- Employee count
    COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS [Current Headcount]
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees m ON d.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID AND e.IsActive = 1
GROUP BY d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName, d.Location, d.Budget, 
         d.CostCenter, d.ManagerID, m.FirstName, m.LastName
ORDER BY d.Budget DESC;
```

**Explanation**: Uses LEFT JOINs for optional relationships, grouping for aggregation, and budget-based categorization logic.

        THEN e.City + ', ' + e.State
        WHEN e.City IS NOT NULL THEN e.City
        ELSE 'Location Not Available'
    END AS [Location],
    
    -- Formatted phone
    CASE 
        WHEN e.Phone IS NOT NULL 
        THEN '(' + LEFT(REPLACE(e.Phone, '-', ''), 3) + ') ' +
             SUBSTRING(REPLACE(e.Phone, '-', ''), 4, 3) + '-' +
             RIGHT(REPLACE(e.Phone, '-', ''), 4)
        ELSE 'Not Available'
    END AS [Phone Number],
    
    e.Email AS [Email Address],
