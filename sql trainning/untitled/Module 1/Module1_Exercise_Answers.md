## Exercise Set 1: SQL Server Architecture (Lesson 1) - Answers

### Exercise 1.1: Instance Information - Answers

**Tasks Solutions**:

1. **Connect to SQL Server instance and retrieve information**:

```sql
-- Basic instance information
SELECT 
    @@SERVERNAME AS ServerName,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName') AS ServerPropertyName,
    @@VERSION AS FullVersion,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS ProductVersion,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') AS ProductLevel,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition,
    SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition') AS EngineEdition,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Collation') AS Collation;

-- System resource information
SELECT 
    cpu_count AS LogicalCPUs,
    physical_memory_kb / 1024 / 1024 AS PhysicalMemoryGB,
    virtual_memory_kb / 1024 / 1024 AS VirtualMemoryGB,
    committed_kb / 1024 / 1024 AS CommittedMemoryGB
FROM sys.dm_os_sys_info;
```

**Questions Answers**:

1. **Difference between @@SERVERNAME and SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName')**:
   - `@@SERVERNAME` returns the name that was set during SQL Server installation
   - `SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName')` returns the current computer name
   - They may differ if the computer was renamed after SQL Server installation

2. **Determining if instance is default**:
   - If `@@SERVERNAME` doesn't contain a backslash, it's the default instance
   - Default instance uses port 1433 by default
   - Named instances include the instance name after a backslash

3. **EngineEdition property meanings**:
   - 1 = Personal/Desktop Engine
   - 2 = Standard
   - 3 = Enterprise
   - 4 = Express
   - 5 = SQL Database
   - 6 = SQL Data Warehouse

### Exercise 1.2: Database File Architecture - Answers

**Tasks Solutions**:

```sql
-- Create test database with specific file settings
CREATE DATABASE ArchitectureTest
ON 
(
    NAME = 'ArchitectureTest_Data',
    FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA\ArchitectureTest.mdf',
    SIZE = 100MB,
    MAXSIZE = 500MB,
    FILEGROWTH = 25MB
),
(
    NAME = 'ArchitectureTest_Data2',
    FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA\ArchitectureTest_Data2.ndf',
    SIZE = 50MB,
    MAXSIZE = 200MB,
    FILEGROWTH = 10MB
)
LOG ON
(
    NAME = 'ArchitectureTest_Log',
    FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA\ArchitectureTest.ldf',
    SIZE = 25MB,
    MAXSIZE = 100MB,
    FILEGROWTH = 5MB
);

-- Query database file information
USE ArchitectureTest;
SELECT 
    file_id,
    name AS logical_name,
    physical_name,
    type_desc AS file_type,
    size * 8 / 1024 AS size_mb,
    max_size * 8 / 1024 AS max_size_mb,
    growth * 8 / 1024 AS growth_mb,
    is_percent_growth
FROM sys.database_files;

-- File usage statistics
SELECT 
    DB_NAME() AS database_name,
    name AS logical_name,
    size * 8 / 1024 AS total_size_mb,
    FILEPROPERTY(name, 'SpaceUsed') * 8 / 1024 AS used_space_mb,
    size * 8 / 1024 - FILEPROPERTY(name, 'SpaceUsed') * 8 / 1024 AS free_space_mb
FROM sys.database_files;
```

**Questions Answers**:

1. **Initial size vs Maximum size**:
   - Initial size: The starting size of the database file when created
   - Maximum size: The largest size the file can grow to (prevents runaway growth)
   - Files grow automatically based on FILEGROWTH settings until MAXSIZE is reached

2. **Separating data and log files**:
   - **Performance**: Reduces I/O contention between data reads/writes and log writes
   - **Reliability**: If one drive fails, the other may still be accessible
   - **Backup strategy**: Allows separate backup schedules for data and logs
   - **Recovery**: Enables point-in-time recovery using log backups

3. **When database file reaches maximum size**:
   - New data insertion/updates that require space will fail
   - Error 1105: "Could not allocate space for object"
   - Database becomes read-only for operations requiring additional space
   - Must increase MAXSIZE or add new files to continue operations

### Exercise 1.3: System Databases - Answers

**Tasks Solutions**:

```sql
-- List all databases including system databases
SELECT 
    name AS database_name,
    database_id,
    create_date,
    collation_name,
    state_desc,
    recovery_model_desc,
    CASE 
        WHEN database_id <= 4 THEN 'System Database'
        ELSE 'User Database'
    END AS database_type
FROM sys.databases
ORDER BY database_id;

-- Examine master database contents (key tables)
USE master;
SELECT 
    'sys.databases' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM sys.databases
UNION ALL
SELECT 'sys.server_principals', COUNT(*) FROM sys.server_principals
UNION ALL
SELECT 'sys.endpoints', COUNT(*) FROM sys.endpoints;

-- Check tempdb configuration
SELECT 
    name,
    physical_name,
    size * 8 / 1024 AS size_mb,
    max_size * 8 / 1024 AS max_size_mb
FROM tempdb.sys.database_files;

-- Model database properties
USE model;
SELECT 
    name,
    collation_name,
    create_date,
    compatibility_level
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'model';
```

**Questions Answers**:

1. **Master database corruption consequences**:
   - SQL Server instance cannot start
   - No access to any user databases
   - Must restore from backup or rebuild master database
   - All instance-level configuration is lost if rebuilt
   - **Prevention**: Regular backups of master database

2. **Why not store user data in system databases**:
   - **System integrity**: Risk of corrupting system functions
   - **Backup/Recovery**: System databases have special backup requirements
   - **Maintenance**: System databases undergo special maintenance procedures
   - **Upgrades**: May be affected during SQL Server upgrades
   - **Security**: System databases have elevated security requirements

3. **Model database role in new database creation**:
   - Template for all new user databases
   - Default size, growth, and recovery model settings
   - Any objects created in model appear in new databases
   - Configuration options are inherited by new databases
